<p class="drop-capi">WHILE I was engaged in writing the
following brief work, again and
again the question arose in my
mind, “Can I make subjects so
deep and difficult really interesting
and intelligible to the young? The importance
of reading Old Testament types in the
light thrown on them by the Gospel cannot,
indeed, be overrated, especially in these
perilous times; but can a child be taught
thus to read them?”</p>

<p>The attempt thus to teach is made in the
following pages; and I would earnestly
request parents and teachers not merely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
place the little volume in the hands of children
as a prettily-illustrated story-book, but
to read it with them, prepared to answer
questions and to solve difficulties. Sunday
books should supplement, not take the place
of, oral instruction. A writer may give
earnest thought and labor to the endeavor
to make religious subjects interesting to the
young; but what influence has the silent
page compared with that of a father expressing
his own settled convictions, or that of a
mother who has the power to speak at once
to the head and the heart?</p>

<p class="drop-capi">“YOU have no right to spoil my desk,
you tiresome, mischievous boy!”</p>

<p>“I’ve not spoilt it, Agnes; I’ve
only ornamented it by carving
that little pattern all round.”</p>

<p>“I don’t call that carving, nor ornamenting
neither!” cried Agnes, in an
angry voice; “you’ve nicked it all round
with your knife, you’ve spoilt my nice
little desk, and I’ll”— What threat Agnes
might have added remains unknown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
for her sentence was broken by a violent
fit of coughing, whoop after whoop—a fit
partly brought on by her passion.</p>

<p>“What is all this, my children?” asked
Mrs. Temple, drawn into the room called
the study by the noise of the quarrel
between her son and her eldest daughter.</p>

<p>Lucius, a boy more than twelve years of
age, and therefore a great deal too old to
have made so foolish a use of his knife,
stood with a vexed expression on his face,
looking at his poor sister, who, in the
violence of her distressing cough, had to
grasp the table to keep herself from falling;
Amy, her kind younger sister had
run to support her; while Dora and little
Elsie, who had both the same complaint,
though in a milder form than their sister,
coughed with her in chorus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Temple’s care was first directed to
helping her poor sick daughter. Agnes,
as well as her three sisters, had caught the
whooping-cough from their brother Lucius,
who had brought it from school. It was
several minutes before the room was
quiet enough for conversation; but when
Agnes, flushed and trembling, with her
eyes red and tearful from coughing, had
sunk on an arm-chair relieved for a time,
Mrs. Temple was able to turn her attention
to what had been the cause of dispute.
A rosewood desk lay on the table, and
round the upper edge of this desk Lucius
had carved a little pattern with the large
sharp knife which he held in his hand.</p>

<p>“I am sure, mamma, that I did not
mean to do mischief,” said Lucius, “nor
to vex Agnes neither. I thought that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
carved desk would be prettier than a
plain one, and so”—</p>

<p>“You might have tried the carving on
your own desk,” said Agnes, faintly. The
tears were rolling down her cheeks, and
she dared not raise her voice lest she
should bring on the whooping again.</p>

<p>“So I might, blockhead that I am; I
never thought of that!” exclaimed Lucius.
“But if you like we will exchange desks
now, and then all will be right. Mine is a
bigger desk than yours, and has not <i>many</i>
ink-stains upon it.”</p>

<p>The proposal set Dora, Amy, and Elsie
laughing, and a smile rose even to the lips
of Agnes. She saw that Lucius was anxious
to make up for his folly; but the big
school-desk would have been a poor exchange
for her own, which was neat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
had red velvet lining; while hers, being
scarcely larger than a work-box, would
have been of little service to Lucius at
school.</p>

<p>“O no! I’ll keep my own desk; the
carving does not look so very bad, after all,”
murmured Agnes, who had an affectionate
heart, though by no means a perfect
temper.</p>

<p>“I took no end of pains with it,” said
Lucius, “and my knife is so sharp that”—</p>

<p>“I would rather that you did not try
its edge on my table,” cried his mother,
barely in time to save her mahogany from
being “ornamented” as well as the desk.</p>

<p>“Stupid that I am! I was not thinking
of what I was about!” exclaimed Lucius,
shutting up the knife with a sharp click;
“but the truth is I’m so horribly sick of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
having nothing to do that I must set about
something. I don’t like reading, I’ve
enough and too much of that at school;
you won’t let me go out, lest the damp
should bring back my coughing and
whooping—I’ve had enough and too much
of that also; I’ve only the girls to play
with, for none of my own friends must
come near the house because of this
tiresome infection; and I shall be taking
to cutting my own fingers off some day
for want of something better to do!”</p>

<p>“It’s a case of idleness being the mother
of mischief,” cried the bright-eyed Dora,
who was busy embroidering with many-colored
silks an apron for little Elsie’s
doll.</p>

<p>“Idleness is indeed very often the
mother of mischief,” observed Mrs. Temple.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
“I am afraid that my young people
often prove the truth of the proverb.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was partly idleness that
made the children of Israel do so very
very wrong when they were wandering
about in the desert,” observed Amy, glancing
up from a book on the subject which
she had been reading.</p>

<p>“Ah! they were shut up in a wilderness
month after month, year after year,” cried
Lucius, “after they had come forth from
Egypt with their flocks and herds and all
kinds of spoil. They had little to do, I
suppose, and may have grown just as tired
of the sameness of their lives as I have of
the dulness of mine.”</p>

<p>“I have often thought,” observed Mrs.
Temple, who had seated herself at the
table and taken up her knitting—“I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
often thought how tenderly the Lord dealt
with his people in providing for them
pleasant, interesting occupation when He
bade them make the Tabernacle, and condescended
to give them minute directions
how it should be made. There were the
various employments of carving, ornamenting,
working in metal, to engage the
attention of the men; while the women
had spinning, weaving, sewing, and embroidering,
with the delightful assurance
that the offering of their gold and silver,
their time and their toil, was made to the
Lord and accepted by Him.”</p>

<p>“I never before thought of the making
of the Tabernacle being a <i>pleasure</i> to the
Israelites,” observed Agnes. “I always
wondered at so many chapters in the
Bible being filled with descriptions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
curtains, silver loops, and gold ornaments,
which are of no interest at all to us now.”</p>

<p>“My child, it is our ignorance which
makes us think any part of the Bible of no
interest,” observed Mrs. Temple. “If you
remember the readiness with which, as
we know, the Israelites brought their precious
things for the Tabernacle, and if you
can realize the eager pleasure with which,
after the long idleness which had ended in
grievous sin, men and women set to work,
you will feel that the order to make a
beautiful place for worship must have been
the opening of a spring of new delight to
the children of Israel. They had the
Lord’s own pattern to work from, so there
was no room for disputes about form or
style; and it was a pattern admirably
suited to give pleasant employment to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
numbers of people, and to women as well
as to men. Fancy how listless languor
must have been suddenly changed to
animation; the murmurs of discontented
idlers to the hum of cheerful workers; and
how vanity and foolish gossip amongst
the girls must have been checked while
they traced out their rich patterns and
plied their needles; and instead of decking
their own persons, gave their gold and
jewels freely to God!”</p>

<p>“I wish that we’d a Tabernacle to make
here,” exclaimed Lucius, whose restless fingers
again opened his dangerous plaything.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple raised her hand to her
brow: a thought had just occurred to her
mind. “We might possibly manage to
make a model of the Tabernacle,” she
said, after a moment’s reflection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, yes! I’d do all the carving part—all
the hard part,” cried Lucius, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Do, do let us make a model!” exclaimed
his sisters.</p>

<p>“It would be a long work—a difficult
work; I am not sure whether we could
succeed in accomplishing it,” said Mrs.
Temple. “And after all our labor, if we
did manage to make a fair model, to what
use could we put it? We had better consider
all these matters before we begin
what must be a tedious and might prove
an unprofitable work.”</p>

<p>“Ah, a model would be of great use,
mamma!” cried Dora. “At Christmas-time,
when this tiresome infection is over,
and we go to our aunt at Chester, we
could show it to all her friends.”</p>

<p>“And to her school children—her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Ragged-school children!” interrupted Lucius
with animation. “We’ve let them see
our magic-lantern for three Christmases
running, and if the children are not tired
of the slides of lions, bears, and peacocks,
I’m sure that I am; besides, I smashed
half the slides by accident last winter. A
model of the Tabernacle would be something
quite new to please the ragged
scholars, and Aunt Theodora would draw
so many good lessons from it.”</p>

<p>“And could we not do with the model
what we did with the magic-lantern,” suggested
Dora, “make of it a little exhibition,
letting aunt’s friends come and see it for
sixpenny tickets, and so collect a little
money to help on the Ragged-school?”</p>

<p>“That would be so nice!” cried Amy.</p>

<p>“That would be famous!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
little blue-eyed Elsie, clapping her
hands.</p>

<p>“Let’s set to work this minute!” said
Lucius, and he rapped the table with his
knife.</p>

<p>Dora threw the doll’s apron into her
work-box, eager to have some employment
more worthy of the clever fingers of a young
lady of more than eleven years of age.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple smiled at the impetuosity
of her children. “I must repeat, let us
consider first,” she observed. “Possibly
not one amongst you has any idea of the
amount of labor and patience required to
complete a model of the Tabernacle which
was made by the children of Israel.”</p>

<p>“Of course our Tabernacle would be
much smaller than the real one was,”
remarked Dora.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“Supposing that we made it on the
scale of one inch to two cubits, I wonder
what its length would be?” said Mrs.
Temple. “Just bring me the Bible.
Lucius, I will turn over to the description
of the Tabernacle, which we will find in
the Book of Exodus.”</p>

<p>“I do not know what a cubit is,” said
Elsie, while her brother ran for the Bible.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember what mamma
told us when we were reading about the
size of the Ark?” said Agnes. “A cubit
is the length of a man’s arm from the
elbow to the end of his middle-finger, just
about half of one of our yards.”</p>

<p>“Eighteen inches, or, as some think
twenty,” observed Mrs. Temple, as she
opened the Bible which Lucius had just
placed on the table before her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s count a cubit as exactly half a
yard, mamma,” said Lucius, “and then
one inch’s length in the model would go
for a yard’s length in the real Tabernacle.
If we reckon thus, how long would our
model need to be?”</p>

<p>“The outer court of the Tabernacle
was one hundred cubits long by fifty
broad,” replied Mrs. Temple; “that, in
such a model as we propose making,
would be a length of four feet and two
inches, by a breadth of two feet and one
inch.”</p>

<p>“Just large enough to stand comfortably
on this side table!” cried Lucius.
“There will be room enough on this
table, and I’ll clear it of the books, work-box,
and flower-jar in a twinkling.”</p>

<p>“Stop a minute, my boy!” laughed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
mother, as Lucius appeared to be on the
point of sweeping everything off, including
the green cloth cover; “we have not
even decided on whether this model
should be made at all; and if we do
begin one, months may pass before we
shall need that table on which to set it
up.”</p>

<p>“O, do, do let us make a model!” again
the young Temples cried out.</p>

<p>“I’m ready to undertake every bit of
the wood-work,” added Lucius, impatient
to use his sharp knife on better work
than that of spoiling a desk.</p>

<p>“First hear what you will have to
undertake,” said his more cautious and
practical mother. “The mere outer court
has sixty pillars.”</p>

<p>“Sixty pillars!” re-echoed the five.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“Besides four more pillars for the
Tabernacle itself,” continued the lady,
“and forty-eight boards of wood, to be
covered all over with gold.”</p>

<p>“How large would each board have to
be?” asked Lucius, more gravely.</p>

<p>“Each five inches long, and three quarters
of an inch broad,” answered his
mother.</p>

<p>“And quite thin, I suppose,” said the
young carpenter, looking thoughtfully at
the blade of his knife which was to accomplish
such a long, difficult piece of work.</p>

<p>“We could get gold-leaf for the gilding,
mamma,” suggested the intelligent Dora,
“and pasteboard instead of wood; pasteboard
would look quite as neat, and need
not to be cut up into boards.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s not the gilding, nor the cutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
up the planks neither, whether they be
made of pasteboard or wood, that puzzles
me!” cried her brother; “but think of
sixty-four pillars! How on earth could I
cut out so many slender little rods with
my knife!”</p>

<p>“Thick wire might be used for the
pillars just as well as pasteboard for the
planks,” said Agnes; “when covered with
gold-leaf they would look just the same
as if”— The sentence was interrupted
by another fit of coughing; it was clear
that poor Agnes was at present little
fitted to join in the conversation.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">“THERE is a picture of the Tabernacle
in your Bible, mamma;
that will help us in arranging
what is to be done; and you will
decide on which of us should do each
portion of the work,” said Dora.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple turned over the leaves
till she came to the picture.</p>

<p>“Here you see a long open court,” she
observed, “enclosed by pillars supporting
curtains of fine linen, fastened to them by
loops of silver. I shall supply the linen
for these curtains, and I think that my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
gentle Amy, who sews so nicely, may make
them. This work will require only neatness
and patience, and my little dove has
both.”</p>

<p>“Ah, mamma! but the silver loops—how
could I make them?” suggested Amy, who
had very little self-confidence.</p>

<p>“I have a reel of silver thread up-stairs
in my box,” said her mother; “you will
make the tiny loops for the curtains of
that.”</p>

<p>“And I will manage the sixty-four
pillars!” cried Lucius; “it was no bad
notion to make them of wire. But they
must be fixed into something hard, to
keep them upright in their places.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of that,” said his
mother; “we shall need a wooden frame,
rather more than four feet by two, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
support the model; and into this frame
holes must be drilled to receive the sixty-four
wires.”</p>

<p>“I must borrow the carpenter’s tools,”
observed Lucius; “I can’t do all that with
my knife. I see that I have a long, difficult
job before me.”</p>

<p>“Do you give it up?” cried little Elsie,
looking up archly into the face of her
brother.</p>

<p>“Not I!” said the schoolboy proudly.
“The harder the work, the more glorious
is success!”</p>

<p>“What are those objects in the court of
the Tabernacle?” asked Amy, who had
been thoughtfully examining the picture.</p>

<p>“That large square object with grating
on the top, from which smoke is rising, is
the Altar of burnt-offering,” said the lady.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
“Through the grating the ashes of animals
that had been slain as sacrifices fell
into a cavity below. The projections
which you see at the four corners
are called the horns of the altar, of
which you read in various parts of the
Bible.”</p>

<div class="caption">THE ALTAR OF BURNT OFFERING.</div><div class="attrib">Children’s Tabernacle</div>            <div class="attribr">p. 30.</div>
</div>

<p>“Was it not an Altar of burnt-offering
that Elijah made on Mount Carmel,”
asked Dora, “when he cut the dead
bullock in pieces and prayed to the Lord
till fire was sent down from heaven?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered her mother, “but
that altar was not like the one in the
picture. Elijah built his up quickly; it
was merely formed of twelve stones.
The altar made by the Israelites in the
desert was framed of wood, and covered
with brass. It was nearly eight feet
square, and was reached, not by steps,
but by a sloping bank of earth.”</p>

<p>“And what is that very large vase
farther on in the picture?” asked Amy.</p>

<p>“That is meant for the Brazen Laver,
to hold water for the priests to wash in.
This laver was made of brass which the
women of Israel offered. Do any of my
girls remember what articles had been
made before of that brass?”</p>

<p>The party were silent for a few seconds,
and then Amy said, with a blush on her
cheek, “The mirrors of the women,
mamma.” The little girl was inclined to
be vain of her looks, and her mother, who
had noticed how much of her Amy’s time
was foolishly spent before a glass, had
drawn her attention, some days before
that of which I write, to a fact which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a><br /><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
been thought worthy of mention in the
Bible. The women of Israel had the
self-denial to give up the brazen mirrors—which
were to them what glass mirrors,
are to us—to form a laver for the use of
the priests when engaged in the service of
God.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple smiled pleasantly to see
that the example of the women in the
desert had not been forgotten by her
child.</p>

<p>“Is not that kind of large tent which is
standing in the court, the Tabernacle
itself?” inquired Dora.</p>

<p>“It is the Tabernacle,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Why is all that smoke coming out of
it?” asked little Elsie.</p>

<p>“That smoke in the picture represents
the pillar of cloud which guided the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Israelites in their wanderings,” said Mrs.
Temple. “For it is written in the book
of Exodus (xl. 38), ‘<i>The cloud of the Lord
was upon the Tabernacle by day, and fire
was upon it by night, in the sight of all the
house of Israel, throughout all their journeys</i>.’”</p>

<p>“What a very holy place that Tabernacle
must have been!” said Amy, in a low
tone of voice.</p>

<p>“There was not only the pillar of cloud
as a visible sign of God’s presence resting
upon it,” observed Mrs. Temple, “but
when Moses had finished making the Tabernacle,
a miraculous light, called by the
Jews, ‘Shekinah,’ and, in the Bible,
‘<i>the glory of the Lord</i>,’ filled the most holy
place.”</p>

<p>“I wish that it were so with holy places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
now!” exclaimed Agnes. “If a cloud
always rested on the roofs of our churches,
and a glorious light shone inside, people
would not be so careless about religion as
they are now.”</p>

<p>“I fear that no outward sign of God’s
presence would long prevent carelessness
and sin,” replied Mrs. Temple.</p>

<p>“What, mamma, not even a shining
glory in church!” cried Amy.</p>

<p>“Remember, my child, all the wonders
and terrors of Mount Sinai—the thunders
and lightnings, the smoke that rose like the
smoke of a furnace, the trembling of the
earth, and the sound of the trumpet exceeding
loud! The Israelites quaked
with fear; they felt how awful is the
presence of God; they implored that the
Lord might only address them through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Moses—‘But let not God speak with us
lest we die!’ cried the terrified people.
And yet, in sight of that very Mount Sinai,
in sight of the thick cloud resting above
it, those Israelites openly broke God’s
commandments, and fell into grievous sin!
Oh, my beloved children, the only thing to
save us from sinning greatly against God
is for our hearts to be the tabernacle in
which He vouchsafes to dwell, and to have
his Holy Spirit shining as the bright light
within! Can any one of you repeat that
most beautiful verse from Isaiah (lvii. 15),
which shows us that the Lord deigns to
dwell with the lowly in heart?”</p>

<p>Of all Mrs. Temple’s family, Agnes had
the best memory; though she had neither
the quick intelligence of her twin-sister
Dora, nor so much of the love of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Heavenly Master which made Amy,
though younger than herself, more advanced
in religious knowledge. Dora had
often admired the verse mentioned by her
mother, and to the humble-minded little
Amy it had brought a feeling of thankful
joy; but it was Agnes who remembered it
best by heart, so as to be able now to repeat
it without making a single mistake.
“<i>Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth
eternity; I dwell in the high and
holy place, with him also that is of a contrite
and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the
humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite
ones.</i>”</p>

<p class="drop-capi">“THE girls will have plenty to do in
making the curtains for the Tabernacle
itself,” observed Lucius,
who, while his mother and sisters
had been conversing, had been engaged
in looking over the description in the
book of Exodus. “Why, there are four
distinct sets of curtains! First, the
undermost, ten curtains of fine-twined
linen, with blue, and purple, and scarlet,
and cherubims of cunning—that must
mean skilful—work upon them!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“How splendid that must be!” exclaimed
Elsie.</p>

<p>“Then a covering of goats’-hair curtains
above these fine embroidered ones,” continued
Lucius; “then a third of rams’-skins
dyed red; and then, to complete the
whole, a covering of badgers’-skin curtains
the outermost of all.”</p>

<p>The four young workwomen were somewhat
startled at the difficulties which
their brother’s words had raised in their
minds. Dora gave a voice to the thoughts
of her sisters when she said, with a look
of disappointment, “It will be hard to
get rams’-skins dyed red, but I do not
know where goats’-hair can be bought
in England; and as for the badgers’-skins,
I am afraid that it will be quite
impossible even for mamma to find such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
a thing, unless it be in the British
Museum.”</p>

<p>“So we must give up making the Tabernacle,”
said Amy, with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay,” cried their smiling mother,
“we must not be so readily discouraged.
Learned men tell us that the Hebrew
word translated into ‘badgers’-skins’ in
our Bible is one of uncertain meaning,
which some think denotes a blue color,
and which, if intended for a skin at all, is
not likely to have been that of a badger.
Blue merino for the outer covering, red
Turkey-cloth instead of rams’-skins, and
mohair curtains instead of goats’-hair,
will do, I think, for our model; as well as
the pasteboard, wire, and gold and silver
thread, which must represent metal and
wood.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lucius, quickly, “they will
do a great deal better than the real materials;
for if we could manage to get
rams’-skins or badgers’-skins to cut up,
such curtains would be a great deal too
thick and heavy for a little model like
ours. Why, our Tabernacle will be only
fifteen inches long by five inches in
breadth.”</p>

<p>All the grave little faces brightened up
with smiles at this way of getting over
what had seemed a very great difficulty.
Elsie looked especially pleased. Pressing
close to her mother, and laying her little
hand on Mrs. Temple’s arm in a coaxing
way, she cried, “Oh, mamma, don’t you
think that I could make one set of the
curtains? You know that I can hem and
run a seam, and don’t make <i>very</i> large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
stitches. Might I not try, dear mamma?
I should like to help to make the Tabernacle.”</p>

<p>It would have been difficult to the mother
to have resisted that pleading young
face, even had Elsie made a less reasonable
request. “I cannot see why these
little fingers should not manage the red
Turkey-cloth which will stand for the
rams’-skins,” replied Mrs. Temple, stroking
the hand of her child; “the outermost
covering of all will, of course, need
finer stitching, and one of the twins will
take that and the mohair besides. To make
both these sets of curtains will take far
less time, and require less skill, than must
be given to the embroidery on linen in blue,
scarlet, and purple, which will adorn the
inner walls and ceilings of our little model.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do, do let me have the embroidery, it
is just the work which I delight in,”
cried Dora; and she might have added,
“excel in,” for she was remarkably clever
in making things requiring fancy and
skill.</p>

<p>Agnes, her twin, flushed very red, not
merely from the straining of the cough
which had frequently distressed her, but
from jealous emotion. Agnes had not a
lowly heart, and in her heart angry feelings
were rising at her sister’s asking that
the finest and most ornamental portion of
the work should be given to her.</p>

<p>“Of course mamma will not let you have
the beautiful embroidery to do, Dora, and
leave the plain mohair and merino to me,
her <i>eldest</i> daughter!” exclaimed Agnes,
laying a proud stress on the word <i>eldest</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
though, there was but an hour’s difference
between the ages of the twins.</p>

<p>“Why, Agnes, what nonsense that is!”
cried Lucius, bluntly; “you know, as well
as I do, that your clumsy fingers can’t so
much as hem a silk handkerchief neatly,
and how would they manage embroidery
in purple, scarlet, and blue? Your bad
work would spoil the whole thing.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you meddle; you don’t know
anything about work!” exclaimed Agnes,
in a loud, angry tone, which brought on
another severe fit of coughing and whooping.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple was grieved at the ill-temper
shown by her eldest daughter, and all
the more so as Agnes was in so suffering
a state as to make it difficult for a mother
to reprove her as she would have done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
had the girl been in health. The lady
had to wait for some time before the cough
was quieted enough for her gentle voice
to be heard, though Amy had quickly
brought a glass of water to help in stopping
that cough. When Agnes could
breathe freely again, the mother thus addressed
her family circle:—</p>

<p>“I should be vexed indeed, my children,
if what I proposed as a pleasant and
profitable occupation for you all, should
become a cause of strife, an occasion for
foolish pride and contention. The Tabernacle
was in itself a holy thing, made so
by the special appointment and presence
of the Lord. I would wish the making
of its model to be a kind of holy employment,
one never to be marred by jealousy
and pride. The profits of your labor, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
there be any, you mean to devote to helping
the poor; therefore I hope that we
may consider the work as an offering to
the Lord—a very small offering, it is true,
but still one which He may deign to accept,
if it be made in a lowly, loving
spirit; but if selfish, worldly feelings creep
in, then good works themselves become
evil. The Israelites were expressly forbidden
to offer any creature in which there
was a blemish or fault, and our offerings
are certainly blemished and spoilt if we
mix with them jealousy and pride.”</p>

<p>Agnes bit her lip and knitted her brow.
She was not without both good sense and
good feeling, but she had not yet obtained
the mastery over her jealous temper.</p>

<p>“I do not see why Dora should be
favored above me,” she murmured.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dora is not favored above you,” replied
the mother, gravely. “The simple
state of the case is this—different talents
are given to different persons. You have
a good memory, Dora a skilful hand.
Were the work in question to be the repeating
of a chapter by heart, Dora would
never expect to be the one chosen to repeat
it. Why should pride make you
refuse to own that there are some things
in which a younger sister may excel you?”</p>

<p>Agnes hesitated, and glanced at her
mother. The girl’s brow was a little
clouded still, and yet there were signs
that her pride was giving way.</p>

<p>“I leave the decision to your own good
sense and feeling, my love,” said Mrs.
Temple. “Judge yourself whether, if
your desire be to make a really beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
model worthy of the good object to which
we devote it, it would be better to place
the embroidery part in Dora’s hands or
your own.”</p>

<p>“Let Dora do it,” said Agnes, with a
little effort, her eyes filling with tears, for
it was hard to her, as it is to most of us,
to wrestle down struggling pride.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple smiled kindly upon her
daughter. “One of the most precious
lessons which we can learn,” said the
mother, “is, in obedience to the command
of our Lord, to be willing to be last of all,
and servant of all. The sacrifice of our
pride and self-will is more pleasing to our
Maker than the most costly gifts can be.
It is worthy of notice that it was not the
<i>outer</i> covering of the Tabernacle, that part
which would be seen from every quarter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of Israel’s camp, that was most beauteous
and precious. The richest curtains were
those seen far less often, those that had
the lowest place in the building. So our
Maker cares far more for what is <i>within</i>
than for what is <i>without</i>, and there is no
ornament so fair in His eyes as that of a
meek and quiet spirit.”</p>

<p class="drop-capi">“I &nbsp; DO not think that the Tabernacle
was a grand building, after all,”
observed Lucius, “though there is so
much written about it in the Bible.
Why, it was only about forty-five feet by
fifteen—not so large as the chapel at the
end of the town, and not for one moment
to be compared to the grand cathedral
which we all went to see last summer.”</p>

<p>“There is one thing which you perhaps
overlook,” said his mother; “when the
Tabernacle was raised, the Israelites were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
a nation of wanderers, and had no fixed
habitation. Their Tabernacle was a large,
magnificent tent, made to be carried about
from place to place by the Levites. Every
portion of it was so contrived as to be
readily taken to pieces, and then put together
again. This could not have been
done with a building of very great size.”</p>

<p>“Nobody could carry about the great
cathedral, or even the little chapel!” cried
Elsie; “but they were never meant to be
moved, they are fixed quite firm in the
ground.”</p>

<p>“The size of the Tabernacle was indeed
not great,” continued Mrs. Temple; “but,
besides its being filled with a glory which
is never beheld now in any building raised
by man, the treasures lavished on it must
have given to it a very splendid appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
It has been calculated that the gold and
silver used in making the Tabernacle must
alone have amounted in value to the enormous
sum of 185,000 pounds!”</p>

<p>Exclamations of surprise were uttered,
and Dora remarked—“Why, that would
be enough to pay for the building of forty
large churches as handsome as the new
one which we all admire so much.”</p>

<p>“And the new church holds ten times
as many people as the Tabernacle could,”
observed Agnes. “I cannot think how a
large nation like the Israelites could find
space to meet in such a small place, only
about twice the size of this room!”</p>

<p>“The Tabernacle was never intended to
be to the Israelites what a church is to
us,” remarked Mrs. Temple. “In the
warm climate of Arabia the people worshipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
in the open air, under the blue
canopy of the sky; no building to shelter
them was required, such as is needful in
England. The men of Israel brought their
sacrifices to the court of the Tabernacle,
where, as you already know, the Altar of
burnt-offering and the Laver were placed.”</p>

</div>

<p>“But, mamma, what was inside the
Tabernacle itself—what was so very carefully
kept under those four sets of curtains?”
asked Dora.</p>

<p>“The Tabernacle was divided into two
rooms by a most magnificent curtain of
rich embroidery called the ‘Veil,’” replied
Mrs. Temple. “The outer room, which
was double the size of the inner, was
named the ‘Holy,’ or ‘Sanctuary.’ In
this outer room were kept the splendid
golden Candlestick with its seven branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>,
each supporting a lamp which burned all
through the night, and the Table of Showbread,
on which twelve cakes of unleavened
bread were constantly kept—the supply
being changed on every Sabbath.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I remember, it was that show-bread
which was given to David when he
was hungry,” said Lucius, “though it was
meant to be eaten only by priests.”</p>

<p>“What other things were in the
outer part of the Tabernacle?” asked
Agnes.</p>

<p>“There was the Altar of Incense, my
love, upon which sweet perfume was daily
burned, so that the room was filled with
fragrance.”</p>

<p>“You have told us, mamma, what was
in the first part of the beautiful Tabernacle;
but what was in the very innermost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
part, the little room beyond the
Veil?” asked Amy.</p>

<p>“That little room, about fifteen feet
square, was called the ‘Holy of Holies,’
and contained the most precious object of
all—the special symbol of the presence of
the Most High. That object was the
Ark, with its cover of pure gold which was
called the ‘Mercy-seat,’ and on which
were figures of cherubim, wrought also in
gold, with wings outstretched. Over this
Mercy-seat, and between the golden cherubim
rested the wondrous glory which
showed that God was with his people.
David, doubtless, referred to this when he
wrote in the eighteenth Psalm, ‘<i>Thou that
dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth!</i>’”</p>

<p>“And were not precious things laid up
in the Ark?” inquired Agnes. “Were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
not the tables of stone on which the
Commandments were written put into it?”</p>

<p>“And the Pot of Manna, kept to remind
the people how their fathers were
fed in the desert?” said Dora.</p>

<p>“And the wonderful rod of Aaron, that
budded, and blossomed, and bore fruit;
was not that also in the Ark?” asked
Lucius.</p>

<p>“All these most precious and holy
things were laid up in the Ark (or as
some think in front of the Ark), beneath
the golden cherubim,” replied Mrs. Temple.</p>

<p>“Oh, I should have liked above all
things to have seen them!” exclaimed
little Elsie. “I should have liked to
have lifted up the splendid curtain-veil,
and to have gone into the Holy of holies—if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the light had not been too dazzling
bright—and have looked upon all those
precious things! Most of all, I’d have
liked to see that wonderful Rod of Aaron,
if it was the very very same rod that had
once been turned into a serpent.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Ah, my child, none of us would have
dared to have lifted that Veil or to have
placed a foot within the Holy of holies!”
exclaimed Mrs. Temple. “No mortal
was ever suffered to enter that place,
most sacred of all, except the High Priest,
and that but on one day of the year—the
Day of Atonement. Aaron himself, the
first High Priest, with trembling awe
must have lifted the Veil, and approached
the Mercy-seat over which the cherubims
spread their wings of gold!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple spoke in so solemn a tone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
that the children felt that the subject was
very sacred, and none of them spoke for
several moments. Then Lucius observed—“There
is now no place on earth into
which no one dare enter, like the Holy of
holies in the Tabernacle of old.”</p>

<p>“No, my son, because the Veil has
been rent in twain, and the Lord Christ,
our great High Priest, has opened a free
way for all believers, even into the Holy
of holies where God dwells in glory for
ever!” said Mrs. Temple, with even greater
reverence in her manner, and clasping
her hands as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Mamma, I cannot understand you!”
cried Amy.</p>

<p>“These are the deep things of God, my
love, and it is very difficult to explain
their meaning to children. The Tabernacle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and the things within it were types,
or as we may call them, pictures of
heavenly mysteries, revealed to us by the
Gospel. But we will not enter now upon
these difficult subjects. I think that you
know a little about the appearance of the
Tabernacle of which you are anxious to
make a model, and also of what was
contained within it. To understand the
meaning of that holy place, and of its
contents, will require much earnest thought
and attention. We may perhaps converse
a little about it to-morrow, which is
Sunday. You will have abundance of
time, as the fear of giving infection to
others obliges me to keep you from going
to church.”</p>

<p class="drop-capi">“I &nbsp; WISH that to-morrow were any
day but Sunday!” exclaimed
Lucius. “Just when one is setting
about a long work, eager to
measure and to make, to cut and to clip,
it is vexatious to have to stop in the
middle of business, to shove away knife,
ruler, pencil, pasteboard, and all, into a
drawer for the next twenty-four hours!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it would be better not to
begin the work at all until Monday,”
mildly suggested his mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“O no, we’ve all the Saturday afternoon,
let’s set to making our model at
once!” exclaimed Lucius.</p>

<p>“Please, please, don’t make us put off!”
cried Dora and Elsie.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple was a very indulgent mother,
and was inclined to be all the more
so as every one of her children was either
suffering from whooping-cough or just
recovering from its effects. Their mother
felt sorry at the necessity for shutting out
her family from many of their usual occupations
and pleasures, and even from the
privilege of going to church. The lady
did not, therefore, in the least press the
subject of delay, but offered, as soon as
early dinner should be over, to go and
search in her drawers and boxes for such
materials as she might think suitable for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the model of the Tabernacle, which her
children were so eager to make. The
dinner-bell sounded while Mrs. Temple
was speaking, and the family went together
to the room in which they took all
their meals, and gathered round the table
which was spread with a plentiful, though
plain repast.</p>

<p>While the young Temples are engaged
with their dinner, let me introduce them
a little more individually to my reader.
There, at the bottom of the table, is Lucius,
a sunburnt, pleasant-looking schoolboy,
with a mass of brown, half-curly locks
brushed back from his forehead. He has
quick eyes and restless hands, which are
seldom perfectly still, even if they have
no better occupation than that of tying
and untying a morsel of string; but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
are now busily plying a large knife and
fork, for Lucius is a skilful carver, and
the joint of mutton is placed before him,
from which to help all the party.</p>

<p>The pale girl seated on the right of
Lucius, with eyes weak and reddened by
the effect of her cough, is Agnes, the
elder of the twins. Her brow is furrowed,
perhaps from the same cause, perhaps
because she is more irritable in temper
than her brother and sisters. But Agnes
is a conscientious girl, one who thinks
much of duty: and we may hope that
“prayer and pains,” which it has been
well said can do anything, will give her
the mastery over faults against which she
is trying to struggle.</p>

<p>Opposite to Agnes sits Dora, who,
though her twin, is not much like her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
being a good deal taller, prettier, and
more animated than she. Dora is a much
greater favorite with Lucius and the
younger girls than the elder twin, from
being gay, obliging, and clever. Agnes is
perfectly aware that such is the case, and
has to pray and strive against the sin of
jealousy, which is too ready to creep into
her heart and poison all her enjoyments.</p>

<p>On either side of Mrs. Temple are her
two younger daughters, Amy and Elsie.
The former, with soft brown eyes and long
flaxen hair tied with blue ribbons, is
strikingly like her mother, who has, at
least so think her children, the sweetest
face in the world. Amy has never been
known to quarrel or utter an angry word,
and is always ready to give help to any
one who needs it. It is no wonder that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
so gentle a girl is beloved. But Amy
knows herself to be by no means faultless,
and is much, on her guard against the
silly vanity which a mother’s watchful
eye has found out to be lurking in the
mind of her dear little girl.</p>

<p>Elsie is a merry blue-eyed child, full of
life and intelligence, forward—rather too
forward for her age. She has for six
years held the place of baby in the home
of her widowed mother, and her family
are rather disposed to indulge her as if
she were a baby still. She enters with
animation into the amusements of the
elder children, and is by no means disposed
to be seen and not heard, as Lucius
often laughingly tells her that such little
people should be.</p>

<p>The conversation during dinner was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
almost entirely on the subject of the
model, and flowed on pleasantly enough,
except when interrupted by coughing;
but all the children were glad when meal-time
was over, and their mother, with
Amy and Elsie skipping before her, went
off to hunt over her little stores for such
materials as might be found useful. Lucius
employed the time of their absence in
exploring the lumber-room for tops of
old boxes or other bits of wood that might,
when fastened together, do for the ground-frame
of the model, into which the gilded
pillars might be fixed. Dora, with pencil
and paper, busied herself in trying to
make an embroidery pattern, introducing
the figures of cherubim. Agnes, who was
too weak for much exertion, and who took
less keen interest in the work than did her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
sisters, lay on the sofa reading a book,
until the return of Amy and Elsie, each of
whom carried some little treasure in her
hands.</p>

<p>“Look, Agnes, look at these shining
reels of gold and silver thread!” exclaimed
the youngest child with eager delight.</p>

<p>“Gold thread—ah! that’s just what I
want!” cried Dora, throwing down her
pencil.</p>

<p>“And here is mamma’s book of gold
leaf; there is a little gold sheet between
every one of the pages,” continued Elsie.
“But oh! it is so thin, so very thin, one
dare not breathe near, or the gold would
all fly away!”</p>

<p>“I thought that gold was a very heavy
metal,” observed Agnes, looking up from
her book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“But it is beaten out into such extreme
fineness that a bit of gold no larger than
a pea would gild all these,” said Lucius,
who had just entered the room with his
arms full of pieces of wood.</p>

<p>“See, Agnes, what we have brought for
you!” cried Amy. “Here is a beautiful
piece of blue merino for the outer curtains
(the badgers’-skin cover, you know), and
blue silk with which to sew it; and here
is another piece of mohair for the goats’-skin
cover, so you are supplied directly
with everything that you need; is not
that nice?”</p>

<p>Agnes did not look so much delighted
as her sister expected that she would;
perhaps because she was scarcely well
enough to take much pleasure in sewing;
perhaps because she had still a lingering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
feeling of mortification at not having been
trusted with the embroidery part of the
work.</p>

<p>“I hope that you have brought me the
fine linen for the beautiful inner curtains,
and the veil for the Holy of holies,” cried
Dora.</p>

<p>“No, mamma cannot find any linen fine
enough, unless she were to tear up her
handkerchiefs, and that would be a pity,”
said Amy. “But mamma has promised
to buy some linen both for your curtains
and for mine that are, you know, to hang
all round the open court of the Tabernacle.”</p>

<p>“It is very tiresome to have to stop at
the beginning for want of fine linen!” exclaimed
Dora. “I hope that mamma
will go out and buy us plenty at once.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah! Dora, you know that mamma
owned this morning that she felt very
tired,” said Amy, a little reproachfully;
“and the shops are a good way off; it is
not as if we lived in the town.”</p>

<p>“Besides, it is raining,” observed Elsie,
who was looking out of the window.</p>

<p>“It is merely a little drizzle, that would
not hurt a fly!” exclaimed Dora. “Mamma
never minds a few tiny drops when
she puts on her waterproof cloak.”</p>

<p>“Mamma never minds anything that
has only to do with her own comfort,”
observed Amy.</p>

<p>“So there is more need that we should
mind for her,” said Agnes.</p>

<p>“I’m sure that I wish that I could go
to the shops myself without troubling, any
one!” exclaimed the impatient Dora. “If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
it were not for this stupid, tiresome infection,
I’d get Lucius to go with me this
minute, and would we not return laden
with linen, pasteboard, and all sorts of
things! But mamma’s fear of setting
other people coughing and whooping
makes her keep us shut up here in prison.”</p>

<p>“Mamma is quite right!” exclaimed
Lucius. “I say so, though I hate more
than you do being boxed up here in the
house.”</p>

<p>“Mamma is quite right,” re-echoed
poor Agnes, as soon as she recovered
voice after another violent fit of coughing,
which almost choked her. “I should not
like to give any one else such a dreadful
complaint as this.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple now entered the room,
with several things in her hand. “I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
found a nice bit of red Turkey cloth,” said
she, “so my little Elsie will be able to set
to work on her curtains at once.”</p>

<p>The child clapped her hands with pleasure,
and then scampered off for her little
Tunbridge-ware work-box.</p>

<p>“I hope that you have found the linen
too, mamma,” cried Dora; “I am in a
hurry for it, a <i>very great</i> hurry,” she
added, regardless of an indignant look
from Agnes, and a pleading one from
Amy.</p>

<p>“I am sorry that I have no suitable
linen,” replied the lady, “but I intend to
go out and buy some.”</p>

<p>“Not to-day, not now, it is raining; you
are tired,” cried several voices; that of
Dora was, however, not heard amongst
them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have here some pasteboard, though
not sufficient for our model, and a bottle
of strong gum which will be most useful,”
said the lady, placing on the table what
she had brought; “but gilt paper will be
needed as well as gold leaf, and of it I
have none; I must procure that, and some
more pasteboard for my dear boy.”</p>

<p>“And plenty of wire, cut into five-inch
lengths for the pillars,” added Lucius.</p>

<p>“And linen for Amy and me,” joined in
Dora.</p>

<p>“But please buy nothing till Monday,”
said Agnes; “the work can wait quite well
for a couple of days.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, do wait till Monday,” cried
the other children; Dora again being the
only exception.</p>

<p>Dora’s selfishness was marring her offering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
as Agnes’s pride had blemished
hers. How difficult it is even in the most
innocent pleasure, even in the most holy
occupation, to keep away every stain of
sin! Ever since the sad time when evil
entered the beautiful garden of Eden, and
Adam and Eve ate of the fruit which God
had forbidden them to taste, pride, selfishness,
and unholiness have been natural to
the human heart. Even when we most
earnestly try to do what we think good
works, how much we need to be on our
guard lest sin creep in to spoil all!</p>

<p>Dora, though silent, showed so plainly
by her looks her extreme impatience to be
supplied at once with the materials for
which she could have so easily waited that
her gentle mother made up her mind to
gratify the wish of her daughter. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Temple put on her waterproof cloak, and,
tired as she was, went forth on a shopping
expedition. It vexed the children to see
that the clouds grew darker and the
shower fell more heavily not long after
their mother had quitted the house.</p>

<p>“If mamma catches cold or has pain in
her face it is all Dora’s fault!” exclaimed
Lucius.</p>

<p>“It was so selfish—so silly not to wait,”
observed Agnes; “just see how the rain
is pouring!”</p>

<p>“I love mamma as much as any of you
do!” cried Dora, her heart swelling with
vexation, so that she could hardly refrain
from tears.</p>

<p>“You love yourself better, that’s all,”
remarked Lucius; and his words were
more true than polite.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Temple returned home very much
tired and rather wet, notwithstanding her
umbrella and waterproof cloak. And
Dora was, after all, disappointed of her
wish to have the linen and begin her
embroidery work directly. Mrs. Temple
had found it difficult to carry home parcels
when she had an umbrella to hold up
on a windy day, and had also feared that
goods might get damp if taken through
driving rain. The wire, pasteboard, gold-paper,
and linen were to be sent home in
the evening, and the longed-for parcel did
not appear until it was time for the twins
to follow their younger sisters to bed.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">THIS well-known hymn was on
Amy’s mind when she awoke on
the following day, and it rose from
her heart like the sweet incense
burnt every morning in the Tabernacle of
Israel. But Dora’s thoughts on waking,
and for some time afterwards, might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
summed up in the words—“Oh, I wish
that this day were not Sunday! How
tiresome it is, when my beautiful pattern
is all ready, not to be able to try it!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple did not appear to be much
the worse for her shopping in the rain.
Her children knew nothing of the aching
in her limbs and the pain in her face
which she felt, as she bore both quietly
and went about her duties as usual.
Dora did not trouble herself even to ask if
her mother were well. It was not that
Dora did not love her kind parent, but at
that time the mind of the little girl was
completely taken up by her embroidery in
scarlet, purple, and blue.</p>

<p>As the children might not go to church,
Mrs. Temple read and prayed with them
at home, suffering none but Lucius to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
her, and letting him read but little, for
fear of bringing back his cough.</p>

<p>All through the time of prayers, though
Dora knelt like the rest of the children,
and was as quiet and looked almost as attentive
as any, her needlework was running
in her mind. If she thought of the happy
cherubim, it was not of their crying “Holy,
holy, holy!” in heaven, but of the forms
of their faces and wings, and how she
could best imitate such with her needle.</p>

<p>I will not say that the other children
thought about the Tabernacle only as
a holy thing described in the Bible, from
which religious lessons could be learnt,—little
plans for sewing, measuring, or
making the model would sometimes intrude,
even at prayer-time; but Lucius
had resolutely locked up his knife, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and three of his sisters at least tried to
give full attention to what their mother
was speaking when she read and explained
the Word of God.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple purposely chose the ninth
chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, a
very difficult chapter to the young, but
one likely specially to interest her family
at a time when the subject of the Tabernacle
in the wilderness was uppermost
in the minds of all. It will be noticed
that Dora did not join at all in the conversation
which followed the reading.</p>

<p>“Mamma, that chapter comes nearly at
the end of the Bible, and is about our
Lord and his death,” observed Lucius;
“and yet it tells us about the Tabernacle,
and its ark, and the high priest going into
the Holy of holies. Now, what could the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Tabernacle in the desert have do with
our Lord and His dying,—that Tabernacle
which was made nearly fifteen hundred
years before the birth of Christ, and
which was no longer of any use after Solomon’s
temple was built?”</p>

<p>“The Tabernacle, the ark, the high
priest, the sacrifices were all <small>TYPES</small> or
figures of greater things to come,” replied
Mrs. Temple. “There was a secret
meaning in them all, referring to our Lord,
His work, and His death, and the glorious
heaven which He was to open to all believers.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what a type is,” said
Elsie.</p>

<p>“It is not clear to me either,” observed
Amy.</p>

<p>“Unless we quite understand what a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
type means, we shall lose much of the
lesson conveyed by the wanderings of the
children of Israel, and the long account of
the Tabernacle, what was in it, and what
was done there, which we find in the
books of Moses,” remarked Mrs. Temple.</p>

<p>“It always seemed to me as if that
Tabernacle were quite a thing of the
past,” said Agnes, “and that it belonged
only to the Israelites of old. I never
could make out why Christian people in
England, thousands of years after the Tabernacle
had quite disappeared, should care
to know anything about it, the ark, or the
altar.”</p>

<p>“But you say that all these things were
types,” observed Amy. “Now, what is a
type, dear mamma?”</p>

<p>“A kind of shadow or picture of something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
usually greater than itself,” replied
Mrs. Temple.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” said Elsie, raising
her blue eyes gravely to the face of her
mother.</p>

<p>“You know, my love, that before you
came to live in this house, when none of
the family but myself had seen it, you
still had some little knowledge of what it
was like.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mamma, for you brought us little
pictures of the house, both of the back
and the front,” said Agnes.</p>

<p>“We knew that it was a pretty white
house, and had a little tower on one side,
and that trees were growing in front, and
creepers all up it!” cried Elsie.</p>

<p>“Now, I might have described the place
to you in writing, but you would not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
known its appearance as well as you did
from the pictures,” observed Mrs. Temple.</p>

<p>“No, from a mere description I should
not have been able to find out the house
directly as I did when I walked alone from
the station,” cried Lucius. “There are
several white houses near this, but the remembrance
of the pictures made me know
in a moment which was the right one.”</p>

<p>“Now, my children, just what a picture
is to the object which it represents, so is a
type to its antitype; that word means the
real thing of which it is a likeness,” observed
Mrs. Temple.</p>

<p>“I am afraid that I am very stupid in
not making out what you mean at once,
dear mamma,” said Amy; “but if you
would explain just one type in the Bible,
I think that I might understand better.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let us take, then, the innermost part
of the Tabernacle, the Holy of holies,”
replied Mrs. Temple. “It was a very
beautiful place, full of the glory of God,
into which no objects were allowed to be
but such as were precious and pure; there
was the mercy-seat like a throne, and
there were the bright cherubim spreading
their golden wings. Now, my children, if
we compare small things to great things,
cannot you of yourselves find out of what
this Holy of holies was a picture or a
type?”</p>

<p>“A type of heaven!” exclaimed several
voices at once; but Amy looked distressed,
and murmured softly, “I hope <i>not</i> a type
of heaven.”</p>

<p>“And why not?” asked Lucius, quickly.</p>

<p>“Because no one was ever allowed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
go into the Holy of holies save one man,
and he only once in the year,” replied
Amy, sadly.</p>

<p>“And that <i>not without blood</i>,” said Lucius,
pointing to the seventh verse of the chapter
which his mother had just been
reading.</p>

<p>“Go on reading, Lucius,” said his parent,
and Lucius, as desired, went on.
“<i>Not without blood, which he offered for himself
and for the errors of the people, the Holy
Ghost thus signifying that the way into the
holiest of all was not yet made manifest.</i>”</p>

<p>“Or, in simpler words,” said Mrs.
Temple, “that the way into heaven was
not yet made plain. When Christ, our
great High Priest, had gone into heaven,
<i>neither by the blood, of goats and calves, but by
His own blood He entered once into the holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
place, having obtained eternal redemption for
us.</i>”</p>

<p>“Then, mother, the high priest must
have been a <small>TYPE</small> of the Lord Jesus
Christ!” exclaimed Lucius.</p>

<p>“No,” interrupted Agnes, “the sacrifice
was the type, the sacrifice whose blood
had been shed.”</p>

<p>“Both high priest and sacrifice were
types of our blessed Saviour,” replied
Mrs. Temple. “The Lord was the victim
offered, and He was also the high priest
who made the offering, for He laid down
His life of Himself, since no man had
power to take it from the Almighty Son
of the Most High.”</p>

<p>“Was there any particular meaning in
the veil of the Temple being rent in twain
from the top to the bottom, as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
our Lord died on the cross?” inquired
Agnes, who had been listening with serious
attention.</p>

<p>“We cannot doubt it,” answered her
mother. “The Temple was the far larger,
more substantial building which took the
place<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> of the Tabernacle of the wandering
children of Israel; it, too, had its veil
of rich work to shut out from mortal view
the Holy of holies. But as soon as the
One great Sacrifice had been offered on
the cross, when the dying Lord could cry
out ‘<span class="smcap">It is finished</span>,’ then followed the
rending asunder of the hiding veil, as
a sign and type that all the Lord’s people,
through His precious blood, might freely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
enter heaven, the real Holy of holies, and
appear without dread of meeting His
wrath in the presence of God the
Father.”</p>

<p class="drop-capi">THE subject of the preceding conversation
had been so exceedingly
solemn that even little
Elsie had a grave look of awe on
her round rosy face, though she could
understand but little of the great mysteries
of which her mother had been speaking.
Elsie could only gather that a type was
like a picture of something much greater
and more wondrous than itself, and said
in her simple, childish way, “Is not a
type like your very tiny photo, mamma,
so little that we could not make out that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
there was any picture at all till we held it
up to the light, and then we could see the
Queen’s great palace quite plain?”</p>

<p>“Elsie has given us a type of a type!”
cried Lucius, clapping his little sister on
the shoulder.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” asked
Agnes.</p>

<p>Lucius was puzzled to explain his own
meaning, which was perhaps not very
clear to himself, so his mother came to
his help.</p>

<p>“Elsie’s very minute photograph is not
a bad illustration of what Bible types
are,” remarked Mrs. Temple. “They
look small, and might almost escape
notice, until the eye of faith sees them in
the clear light of God’s Word, and then
what seemed little more than a speck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
may be found to be a likeness of something
grander far than a royal palace.”</p>

<p>“It would be interesting to find out
some other Bible types,” observed Agnes.</p>

<p>“I was just going to propose that while
I attend afternoon service, you should all
occupy the time of my absence in each
finding a type, which we can talk over in
the evening,” said Mrs. Temple.</p>

<p>“I should like that!” cried Lucius; “I
am glad of anything to make the afternoon
less dull; for I know that as it is damp to-day
we shall all have to keep within
bounds,” he added, Agnes having just
begun a fit of coughing.</p>

<p>“I should like to find a Bible type if
I could, but I’m afraid that I am too
stupid,” said Amy.</p>

<p>“You and me, we’ll try together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>”
cried Elsie, laying her plump dimpled
hand on that of her sister.</p>

<p>“Ah! you think that union is strength,
Pussie!” cried Lucius; “and that you
two youngest of the party will together be
a match for any one of the rest.”</p>

<p>Little Elsie’s brain had now been quite
long enough on the stretch, and after
jumping upon her mother’s knee to give
her “a good tight kiss,” the child ran off
to play with her Noah’s Ark. The family
then dispersed to various parts of the
house, soon to reassemble at the cheerful
sound of the dinner-bell.</p>

<p>After Mrs. Temple had started for
church, Lucius, Agnes and Amy took up
their Bibles to search in them for types,
while little Elsie amused herself with a
book of Scripture pictures. Dora went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the room called the study, in which the
children usually learned their lessons in
the morning, and amused themselves in
the evening, and in which they kept their
workboxes and desks, and most of their
books. Dora found no one in the study,
and sauntered up to the side table,
covered with green cloth, on which stood
her neat little workbox.</p>

<p>“Of course I am not going to do one
stitch of my embroidery to-day, because
this is Sunday,” said Dora to herself.
“But there can be no harm in just looking
at my pretty pattern, and seeing whether
it is likely to do for the inner curtains and
veil.”</p>

<p>Dora opened the box, and took out the
pattern which lay on the neatly-folded
piece of linen which her mother had given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to her just before the twins had gone up-stairs
to bed. Dora admired her own
pattern, which was realty drawn out with
some skill, but she saw that it was not
quite perfect. Her pencil lay close at
hand; Dora could not, or did not, resist
the temptation to put in a few touches to
this and that part of the drawing.</p>

<p>“I wonder how I should arrange the
colors,” thought Dora; “I wish that I
had more scarlet in my reel, and I think
that my blue skein is too dark; Agnes has
some sky-blue sewing silk, I know. Perhaps
that would be better, or both shades
might have a pretty effect, mixed with the
scarlet and purple.”</p>

<p>Dora took out her reels and skeins, and
placed them beside her pattern, and tried
to imagine the effect of the different combination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of color. Would it be well for
the cherubim to be worked in purple or
blue, or entirely in thread of gold, like
their wings? Dora was inclined to think
the last plan best, only gold thread is so
stiff, and difficult to manage.</p>

<p>“I shall never go to rest till I have
made up my mind about this,” muttered
Dora to herself, “and how can I decide
what will be best till I try? And why
should I not try?” Dora, with her
colored silks before her, was, like Eve,
looking at the forbidden fruit, and listening
to the voice of the Tempter, who
would persuade her that evil was good.</p>

<p>“There are some things which even
mamma says are quite lawful to be done
on Sundays, such as charitable works.
Mamma herself dressed the cook’s scalded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
arm upon a Sunday, and put in a stitch or
two to keep the bandages firm. <i>That</i> was
surely sewing on a Sunday, but then that
was a work of charity. Well, but mine is a
work of charity, too.” Thus Dora went
on, while the dangerous current of inclination
was gradually drifting her on towards
breaking in act the Fourth Commandment,
which she had all day long been
breaking in thought. “Our Tabernacle
is to be the model of a holy—a very holy
thing, just the kind of a thing which it is
right to think about on Sunday. Then it
is to be made for a very charitable purpose.
I am sure that bandaging the
cook’s arm is no better work than helping
a ragged school; I don’t think that it is
really as good, for aunt’s poor little pupils
are taught to love God and read the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Bible. No, it surely cannot be wrong to
assist such an excellent work on any day
in the seven.”</p>

<p>Dora unrolled a length of blue silk, took
out a needle and threaded it. She had
almost succeeded in silencing conscience,
at least for a time; she had almost persuaded
herself that in amusing herself she
was helping a holy cause; and that God
would not be displeased at her breaking
His commandment, because she was going
to work for the poor. There is, perhaps,
no more dangerous error than to think
that the end justifies the means—that it is
lawful to a Christian to do evil that good
may come. Oh, dear young reader! if
you ever find yourself trying to quiet conscience
by the thought that to do a great
good you may do a little harm, start back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
as if you caught sight of the tail of a
snake in your path! Yes, for the serpent
who deceived Eve is trying to deceive you
also. If Dora had been honest and candid
with herself, she would have seen, as her
fingers busily plied the needle, that she
was really working for her own pleasure;
that her embroidering a piece of linen was
an utterly different thing from her mother’s
bandaging a badly-scalded arm, and relieving
a sufferer’s pain. To cases of
necessity such as that, the Saviour’s words
truly applied—“It is lawful to do good on
the Sabbath-day;” but there was nothing
to justify Dora in following her own inclination,
and working on the day appointed
for holy worship and rest.</p>

<p>If there was really no harm in what she
was doing, why was it that Dora started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
so when she heard her mother’s voice at
the door of the study, and why did she so
hurriedly thrust linen, pattern, and silks
back into the workbox as her gentle
parent entered the room?</p>

<p>Dora’s back was turned towards the
door, so that, from her being between it
and the table, Mrs. Temple could not see
the cause of the little bustling movement
which she noticed on coming into the
study.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, my love?” asked
the lady.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” answered Dora quickly, as she
succeeded in shutting down the lid of her
workbox. The word was uttered in haste,
without reflection; but the instant after
it had passed her lips a pang shot through
the young girl’s heart, for she was aware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
that, perhaps for the first time in her life,
she had uttered a downright falsehood.
Conscience could be silenced no longer;
the second sin into which Dora had been
drawn by her fear showed her in a strong
light the nature of the first, into which
she had been drawn by her love of
amusement. If she had not been doing
what was wrong, she would not have been
afraid lest her occupation should be found
out by her tender, indulgent mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple never doubted the word of
one of her children, but she could not help
thinking that the manner of Dora was
strange, and she would probably have
inquired further into its cause, had she
not just then been followed into the study
by Lucius. The boy had his Bible in his
hand, and a thoughtful, perplexed look on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
his face, which at once fixed the attention
of Mrs. Temple. Dora was glad that her
mother’s attention should be drawn by
anything from herself, for otherwise she
could not have hidden her confusion. She
seated herself on a stool by the window,
with her face turned away from her parent,
and there remained a silent listener to the
following conversation between Mrs. Temple
and her son. Whether that conversation
was likely to make Dora’s conscience
easier or not, I leave the reader to judge.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">“I &nbsp; HAVE been looking out for a type,
mamma, as you wished us to do,” said
Lucius, seating himself on the sofa on
which his parent had taken her place,
and resting his Bible upon her knee. “I
am not sure whether I may not have heard
already from you that Abraham’s sacrificing
his dear son is a kind of shadow of
God’s sacrificing His only Son; at any
rate, I thought of this as the type which
I should choose to speak of in the evening.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“You could hardly have chosen a more
remarkable type, my boy. I believe that
Abraham was commanded to sacrifice his
son not only to try the fond father’s faith
and obedience, but also that Isaac ascending
Mount Moriah with the wood for the
burnt-offering on his shoulder, might be
to the end of time a type of the blessed
Saviour bearing the cross on which He
was to suffer on Calvary.”</p>

<p>“Ah! mother, it is all that suffering and
sacrificing that is such a difficulty to me!”
exclaimed Lucius. “Why is so much
suffering needed at all?” The boy looked
earnestly into his mother’s face as he
spoke.</p>

<p>“It is a sad mystery, Lucius; we do not
fully understand it; but one thing is certain,
not only from what we read in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Bible, but from what we see in the world
around us, and that thing is that sin and
suffering are bound together, we cannot
separate them; suffering is the shadow of
sin and <i>must</i> follow it; <small>THE WAGES OF SIN
IS DEATH</small> (Rom. vi. 23).</p>

<p>“But you have taught us that <span class="smcap">God is
love</span>,” said Lucius, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Surely God is love,” replied Mrs.
Temple; “God loves man, but God hates
sin, which is the greatest enemy of man.
It is God’s merciful will that man should
be saved <i>both</i> from sin here, and from its
most terrible punishment hereafter.”</p>

<p>“The Holy of holies is a difficulty to
me,” observed Lucius; “why should no
man, save the high priest, be suffered to
go in, or draw near the mercy-seat of
God?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ask yourself what lesson this would
have taught you had you been one of the
children of Israel,” said Mrs. Temple.
“When you beheld the Tabernacle with
the wondrous cloud resting upon it, and
gazed through the opening in front on the
veil which hid from your eyes the more
dazzling glory within—that glory which
was a sign of the immediate presence of
God, into which on pain of death you
dared not enter—what would have been
the thought uppermost in your mind?”</p>

<p>“The thought that God was terribly
holy, and that no human being was fit to
come near Him,” replied Lucius, gravely.</p>

<p>“But one man was allowed to draw
near,” observed Mrs. Temple.</p>

<p>“Only the high priest, and that with
the blood of a sacrifice,” said her son.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“And so mankind were taught that
there <i>is</i> a way to approach a holy God,
but <i>only one way;</i> they were taught that
sacrifice was needful, that <small>WITHOUT SHEDDING
OF BLOOD THERE IS NO REMISSION</small> (forgiveness
of sin), Heb. ix. 22.</p>

<p>“But, mother, surely God does not
require the blood of bulls and goats!”
cried Lucius.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple in reply turned over the
leaves of the Bible, till she found the
fortieth Psalm, and then read aloud,</p>

<p>“<i>Burnt-offering and sacrifice hast Thou not
required. Then said I, Lo! I come; in the
volume of the book it is written of Me, I
delight to do Thy will, O my God.</i>” It is
the Lord Jesus Christ who says this by
the mouth of David. The blood of lambs
and other creatures was worthless, save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
as signs and pledges of the precious blood
of Christ which cleanseth from all sin,
(John i. 7,) the blood of Him who is indeed
<span class="smcap">the Lamb of God that taketh away the
sin of the world</span> (John i. 29).</p>

<p>“It seems so sad that the Lord, who
had done no sin, should have to bear all
that agony on the cross,” murmured
Lucius.</p>

<p>“Christ bore it in our <small>STEAD</small>,” said Mrs.
Temple; “He suffered the punishment for
sin, that sinners, repenting and believing,
might be saved, forgiven, and made happy
forever.”</p>

<p>“I still cannot clearly make out the use
of sacrifices—I mean of animals,” said
Lucius.</p>

<p>“They taught that one being may suffer
instead of another,” replied Mrs. Temple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
speaking slowly, that her son might weigh
well every word. “When an Israelite
brought a lamb for sacrifice it was just as
if he had said, ‘O holy God, I know that I
am a sinner, and that I deserve to suffer
for my sin; but in mercy accept the life of
this lamb <i>instead of mine</i>.’ It was to teach
this same lesson that Aaron the high
priest was commanded to lay his hands on
the head of a living goat, and confess over
him the sins of all the children of Israel.
The scape-goat (as it was called), was then
sent away into the desert, bearing away
with him all the sins which had been
solemnly confessed over him by the high
priest of God. With a thankful heart and
lightened conscience must every faithful
Israelite have seen the scape-goat led
away from the camp. ‘My sins are taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
from me, far as the east is from the west,’
he might say, ‘I shall never, never have to
bear that terrible burden myself.’”</p>

<p>“But why have we no scape-goats and
no sacrifices now?” asked Lucius; while
Dora silently thought, “What a comfort
it would be to see all one’s sins carried
far away from us forever!”</p>

<p>“We need no more such sacrifices now,”
replied Mrs. Temple, “because the One
great Sacrifice which Christ made of Himself
on the cross is so infinitely precious,
that it is enough to save a world that was
lost from sin. We need no scape-goat
now, for when Christ went forth to die,
He carried away with Him the burden of
the guilt of all His people.”</p>

<p>“But then, mother, is every one’s sin
taken away, is every one sure to enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
heaven, the real Holy of holies?” asked
Lucius. The question was a very important
one, and poor Dora’s heart beat fast
as she listened to hear what answer her
parent would give to the boy.</p>

<p>“No, my son,” replied Mrs. Temple, “for
not every one has true faith in the Lord
and His Sacrifice, that faith which makes
us repent of sin, be sorry for sin, confess
it and try to forsake it. We know that
(two only excepted) all the Israelites above
a certain age never reached the good land
of Canaan, but all died in the desert. And
why was this? It was because they had
sinned against God. They might have
sacrifices but they had not true faith; they
might give up lambs, but they gave not up
sin; they might have God’s presence in the
tabernacle to guide them, but they did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
let their conduct be guided by the light of
His holy Word.”</p>

<p>“It almost seems to me,” observed
Lucius, “as if the Israelites wandering
about in the desert were types of us—of
all who are now called Christian people.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple smiled with pleasure to see
that her son was beginning really to understand
a little of Old Testament teaching
by types. “Yes, dear boy,” she replied,
“the history of the Israelites is just like a
picture or type of what is now happening
to ourselves in our journey through life
towards heaven, our promised Canaan.
They were first in bondage to cruel Pharaoh;
we are born into the world in bondage
to sin. The Israelites at the beginning
of their journey passed through the
Red Sea; St. Paul shows us that this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
a type of Christian baptism (1 Cor. x. 2).
I could go on to show you how the history
of Israel is full of many other interesting
types of our own, but you have heard
enough for the present. There are just a
few most important lessons which I would
wish to impress on your mind. They are:</p>

<p>“First, that we all are sinners.</p>

<p>“Secondly, that we can only be forgiven
and enter heaven through the Sacrifice of
our Lord on the cross.</p>

<p>“Thirdly, that His Sacrifice takes away
all sin from those who have true faith in
their hearts; that faith whose reality is
shown by its making us repent of and try,
by God’s help, to give up our sins.”</p>

<p class="drop-capi">DORA felt very unhappy. She had
broken the holy rest of the Lord’s
day; she had repeated prayers
without praying, heard God’s Word
read without attending, had made a vain
show of religion; and at last had worked
and worked hard at her needle, as she
might have done on any other day of the
week. Dora had disobeyed what she
knew to be the wishes of her mother, and
then to hide such disobedience had uttered
a lie to deceive her! The girl could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
conceal from herself that she had done what
was wrong—exceedingly wrong; that she
had displeased a holy God, whose eyes are
in every place beholding the evil and the
good.</p>

<p>“Oh, what can I—what ought I to do
now!” thought Dora, as slowly and sadly
she went up to her own little room. Conscience
gave an instant reply, “Retrace
your steps as quickly as you can, own
your fault to your mother, and ask forgiveness
from God.” But Dora was very
unwilling to do this; she was inclined to
take a kind of half-way course.</p>

<p>“I need not say anything to mamma
about what I have done,” thought Dora.
“I will not touch my pretty work any
more on Sunday; and to-morrow, as soon
as I get up, I will unpick every stitch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
what I have been sewing to-day. That
will be a good punishment for me; yes,
that will be the right kind of punishment
for breaking the Fourth Commandment.”</p>

<p>Dora half satisfied her conscience by
making this resolution to undo what ought
not to have been done; but the little girl
made a grievous mistake in supposing
that any self-inflicted punishment can take
away sin. We must go straight to the
Lord for forgiveness, and ask it only for
the sake of the Lamb of God, who suffered
to take away guilt; and when we have
sinned against our fellow-creatures, as well
as against our Heavenly Father, we must
honestly and openly confess to them what
we have done, and ask their forgiveness.
Dora shrank from doing this; she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
extremely unwilling to own to her mother
that she had been sewing on Sunday.</p>

<p>“Perhaps mamma would take away from
me the making of the embroidered curtains
altogether,” thought Dora, “and give it to
Agnes instead; and then all the family
would know the reason, and I should be
lowered in the opinion even of little Elsie!
Oh, how dreadfully ashamed I should feel,
and what a bitter disappointment it would
be to see the work in the hands of another,
after I have taken such pains to draw out
that beautiful pattern! Worst of all, Aunt
Theodora would hear of my fault when we
go to be with her at Christmas. She
would be sure to ask why I had not
embroidered the veil and the curtains, for
she thinks that I embroider so well. Oh,
I could not bear that the aunt whom I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
love so much—who loves me so much—should
know what I have done! No, no,
there is no use in speaking about the
matter at all; I will punish myself by the
tiresome unpicking, and then all will be
right.”</p>

<p>Would all be right? Were Dora to
punish herself ever so severely, would all
be right? No, dear reader, no! self-punishment
cannot wash away sin.</p>

</div>

<p class="unindent">Dora was only deceiving herself now, as
she had an hour before deceived her indulgent
mother.</p>

<p>In the evening, after tea-time, the family
assembled again in the study. Their
usual employment on Sunday evenings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
had been to sing hymns with their mother,
each in succession choosing a favorite
hymn; but the whooping-cough had for
weeks past put a stop to all singing, and it
had cost Mrs. Temple some thought to find
a way of making the evening Sabbath
hour as pleasant to her family as it had
usually been. The searching in the Bible
for types had been a new kind of occupation,
and had made the afternoon seem less
long to the young prisoners at home than
it might otherwise have appeared during
the absence of their mother at church.
The family circle looked a very happy one
by the light of the fire round which they
gathered; for autumn was beginning, the
weather, though not very cold, was damp;
and the illness from which the children
were recovering made warmth and dryness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
so desirable, that the fire was always
lighted at sunset.</p>

<p>“I like when we sit so cosy together
before the blazing fire!” exclaimed little
blue-eyed Elsie, cuddling close to her
mother. “I hope that Eliza won’t bring
in the candles; no one wants candles to
talk by. Agnes, you won’t cough so badly
if you put your feet here on the fender;
please, Lucius, give the fire a good stir,
and make the red flames leap up and
dance. Are we not a happy party!” she
added, squeezing tightly her mother’s
hand in both of her own.</p>

<p>Smiling faces gave the reply. There
was but one face that wore no smile. Dora
sat on the other side of her mother, but
the girl had drawn her chair a little back
from the half-circle before the fire, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
held a hand-screen before her face, not
really to protect it from the scorching
blaze, but that it might not be seen by
the fire-light. Dora was glad, though not
for the same reason as Elsie, that Eliza
did not bring in the candles.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">“MAMMA, I’ve been trying to find
a type; I’ve been looking all
through my Bible pictures,” said
blue-eyed Elsie.</p>

<p>“And did you succeed in finding a type,
my darling?” asked Mrs. Temple, smiling
at the gravity of the child, whom she
thought scarcely likely to be able to discover
the meaning of the most simple
Scripture figure.</p>

<p>“I don’t know—I’m not sure,” said
little Elsie; “but I’ve found two pictures—one
in the Old Testament and one in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the New Testament—and they are rather
like each other; so, you know, dear
mamma, it seemed as if one might be
a sort of a type.”</p>

<p>“And what were your pictures about,
Elsie, pet?” asked Lucius, stroking the
hair of his youngest sister, of whom the
schoolboy was very fond.</p>

<p>“One picture was of Elijah raising the
poor widow’s son, and the other was of
the Lord’s raising a widow’s son. These
were two things like each other,” said
Elsie; “but,” she added, shaking her
curly head thoughtfully, “I can’t tell if
there was any type.”</p>

<p>“I daresay that little Elsie is right,
and that Elijah <i>was</i> a type of the Lord!”
cried Lucius, “for did they not both fast
forty days in the wilderness?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought that Elijah was rather a
type of John the Baptist,” observed Agnes.</p>

<p>“Yes, he was so,” said Mrs. Temple.
“Our Lord’s own words show that John,
‘the Voice crying in the wilderness,’ came
in the spirit and power of the prophet
Elijah, though John worked no miracle.
Yet in the two instances which your
brother and Elsie have noticed, the raising
of the dead and the forty days’ fast in
the desert, Elijah’s history shadows forth
that of One far greater than himself. Has
my dove Amy thought of any Scripture
type?” said the mother, turning towards
her young daughter.</p>

<p>Amy hesitated a little; she was always
distrustful of herself, and in this was
a great contrast to Elsie. Mrs. Temple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
smiled encouragingly upon her little girl.
“I see that there is something in your
head,” said the mother; “tell us, my love,
what you have thought of. If you have
made a mistake, I will try to set you
right; we are at least likely to gain some
increase of Scriptural knowledge by talking
over such subjects as these.”</p>

<p>“I thought at first that I should never
find out anything,” said Amy; “though
you explained to us so much about types
this morning, dear mamma, I felt quite
puzzled when I tried to make out one for
myself. At last a verse from the third
chapter of John came into my mind, and
I wondered whether our Lord Himself
taught Nicodemus in it something about
a type. Perhaps Nicodemus understood
the Lord’s meaning, but I could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
understand it—that is to say, not clearly—so
I thought that I had better ask you
about it, mamma.”</p>

<p>“What is the verse?” asked several
voices at once.</p>

<p>Amy folded her hands reverentially as
she repeated the sacred words once spoken
by our blessed Redeemer. Mrs. Temple
would never allow her children to gabble
over carelessly any verse of Scripture.—“‘<i>As
Moses lifted up the serpent in the
wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted
up, that whosoever believeth Him should not
perish, but have eternal life</i>,’” (John iii. 14, 15.)</p>

<p>“Most certainly, our Lord spoke then
of a most remarkable type,” said Mrs.
Temple. “To what coming event in his
own life did our Saviour refer in the
expression ‘be lifted up’?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“To His being lifted up on the cross,”
said Amy, in a low tone of voice.</p>

<p>“And why was the Son of God lifted
up on the dreadful cross?” asked her
mother.</p>

<p>“That we—that all who believe in Him
shall have eternal life,” replied Amy
Temple.</p>

<p>“It was indeed as a type of this great
salvation from eternal death that the
brazen serpent was lifted up by Moses,”
said the lady. “Do you remember what
had happened to the Israelites to make
the raising of the brass serpent needful
to save them from destruction brought on
by sin?”</p>

<p>As Amy did not immediately reply to
the question, Elsie eagerly put in her
word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“You told us all about it last Sunday,
mamma; I remember the story quite
well. The people had been wicked, very
wicked, and so fiery serpents came amongst
them and bit them; and many—I don’t
know how many—Israelites died, because
no doctor knew how to cure them.”</p>

<p>“Were those deadly bites a type of sin
whose wages are death?” asked Lucius.</p>

<p>“They were so, my son,” said his
mother. “Man had no way of saving
those who had received the deadly wound,
so God himself showed Moses a way. The
Lord bade him lift up on high a serpent of
brass, and promised that whoso <i>looked</i>
upon it should live.”</p>

<p>“I cannot imagine how mere <i>looking</i>
could do the least good to a person dying of
the poison of a snake-bite,” observed Agnes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Almighty willed that it should be
so,” said Mrs. Temple; “He willed that
the look of faith should bring healing to a
sick body, as the look of faith at a
crucified Saviour still brings healing to
the sin-wounded soul. When I read how
my Lord says, through the prophet Isaiah,
‘<i>Look unto Me, and be ye saved, all the ends of
the earth</i>’ (Isaiah xlv. 22), I think of the
brazen serpent, and know that I have but
to believe in Christ and be saved.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by the look of
faith?” inquired Agnes.</p>

<p>“Faith is simply <i>believing</i>,” replied Mrs.
Temple. “To look to Christ is to believe
that He is able and willing to save us, and
that none can save us but He.”</p>

<p>Dora, who had chosen, as we know, to
sit a little drawn back from the circle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
with a screen in her hand, now dropped
the screen on her lap, and leant forward,
so that the red flickering gleam of the
fire-light shone on her face as she anxiously
asked, “Then are we quite, quite safe,
sure never to be punished for anything
evil that we have done, if only we have
faith that the Lord will save us?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if the faith be <i>real</i>, living faith,”
replied Mrs. Temple.</p>

<p>“Are there then two kinds of faith?”
inquired Lucius.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered his mother; “we read
in the Bible of two kinds of faith or
belief—one dead and one living.”</p>

<p>“I cannot understand that at all,” said
Amy.</p>

<p>“I will try to explain,” said the lady
“and I ask you, my children, to give me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
your full attention, for this is a matter of
the greatest importance. You all believe,
do you not, that there is an Emperor
of Germany?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” replied the children: and
Elsie added with a little nod, “I believe
there is such a man, though I never have
seen him.”</p>

<p>“Now does your belief in the existence
of the Emperor—that is, your <i>faith</i> in it—does
it make the smallest difference in
your actions, or words, or feelings?” inquired
Mrs. Temple.</p>

<p>“No, why should it?” cried Lucius.</p>

<p>“The Emperor does not care for us; he
knows nothing about us,” said Elsie.</p>

<p>“Then your faith in the Emperor is a
<i>dead</i> faith, it has no effect on your hearts,”
observed Mrs. Temple. “And this is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
kind of faith which many persons, alas!
have in the Lord. They believe in a
careless sort of way that Christ once lived
in the world, and died on the cross, but
they believe only with the head, not with
the heart. And this is <i>dead</i> faith, a kind
of faith which never can save us.”</p>

<p>“But what is <i>living</i> faith, then?” asked
Amy.</p>

<p>“When our belief makes us really love
Him who first loved us,—when the thought
of Christ’s dying for sin makes us hate sin,
that cost Him so dear, then our faith must
be living faith; and thus looking to the
Lord we are saved.”</p>

<p>Dora sighed and drew her head back
again into the shadow. Hers was not a
faith that had kept her from sin—hers was
not a faith that made her now obey the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
whisper of conscience, confess her fault to
her mother, and make what amends she
could for what she had done.</p>

<p>“Depend upon it, that when an Israelite
had been cured of his wound by looking
at the brazen serpent, he did not go
and stroke and play with the fiery reptile
that had bitten him,” observed Lucius,
who had the clearest head amongst the
party, and best entered into the meaning
of types.</p>

<p>“No, he would run away from the horrid
creatures, or try to kill them; he
would put his foot upon the fiery serpents
and crush them—crush them,” cried Elsie,
stamping her little foot on the hearthrug,
to add force to her words.</p>

<p>“So every one who has living faith
dreads and hates sin, and tries to destroy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
it,” observed Mrs. Temple. “We will not
carelessly trifle with it <i>if we believe from
our hearts</i> that our blessed Redeemer suffered
because of our sins.”</p>

<p>“What a very holy thing was that
brazen serpent which Moses set up on a
pole!” exclaimed Amy. “Did he not
afterwards put it into the ark, that the
Israelites might carry it about with them
wherever they went, and treasure it as
they did the tables of stone on which the
Commandments were written?”</p>

<p>“We do not read of Moses putting the
brazen serpent into the ark,” replied Mrs.
Temple; “but the Israelites must have
carried it with them in their wanderings
through the desert, and have taken it into
the Promised Land, for we read of the
brazen serpent being greatly honored by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the people more than seven hundred years
after it was lifted up.” (1 Kings xviii. 4.)</p>

<p>“It was quite right that the Israelites
should honor it very, very much,” cried
Elsie, “because the brazen serpent had
saved so many people from dying.”</p>

<p>“You mistake, my child,” said her
mother. “The brass image had no power
in itself to save a single creature from
death; it was of no use at all but as a
means appointed by God. The brazen
serpent was a <i>type</i> of salvation; and when
the Jews took to burning incense to the
mere type, that is, when they paid to it the
honor which is due to God alone, they fell
into sin.”</p>

<p>The younger children looked surprised;
and Amy murmured, “Then can even a holy
thing lead men to do what is wrong?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“Men do wrong, exceedingly wrong,
when they put anything, however holy
it may seem in their eyes, in the place of
God,” observed Mrs. Temple. “When
good king Hezekiah saw that his people
were honoring the brazen serpent too
much, what do you think that he did?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he locked it up, so that no one
could get at it,” cried little Elsie.</p>

<p>“Hezekiah took a much stronger measure
than locking up the image,” said her
mother. “The good king broke the
brazen serpent into pieces, and called it
Nehustan, or a piece of brass, to show
both by word and deed that the most holy
and interesting relic may lead to the sin of
idolatry, if it draw away our thoughts
and our hearts from the Lord who alone
can give us salvation.”</p>

<p class="drop-capi">“AS we seem to be giving in our types
youngest by youngest, it is Dora’s
turn now to tell us which she has
chosen,” said Lucius.</p>

<p>“Ah! Dora will have found out the
most interesting type of all, Dora is so
clever!” cried Elsie, who had great faith
in the intelligence of the brighter of the
twins.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned towards Dora as
she sat in the shadow, but Dora’s own
eyes were bent on the hearthrug. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
had been so much taken up on that Sunday,
first with her embroidery, then with
the conversation between her mother and
Lucius, and the painful struggle in her
own mind with an upbraiding conscience,
that Dora had not even thought of looking
out for a type in Scripture.</p>

<p>“What have you chosen, Dora?” asked
Lucius.</p>

<p>“I have not chosen any type yet, I
have not had time,” stammered out Dora,
confused and mortified to find herself behind
even little Elsie, who looked astonished
at the words of her sister.</p>

<p>“Not time! why, you have had as much
time as any of us,” said Agnes. “What
were you doing all the afternoon while
mamma was at church?”</p>

<p>“Nothing particular,” said Dora, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
a little confusion. Again a pang shot
through the heart of the conscious girl
for she knew that she was again staining
her lips with untruth.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say that you were
sitting from two o’clock till five, with your
hands before you, and thinking about
nothing at all,” said Lucius.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Dora was reading that interesting
book about the poor French Protestants,”
suggested Amy.</p>

<p>Dora did not speak. She was too well
pleased, alas! that her family should believe
that she had been thus engaged,
though she knew that she had not so
much as opened the volume in question.</p>

<p>“It would have been better, my love,
for you to have entered into the occupation
which interests your brothers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
sisters,” said Mrs. Temple, in a tone of
gentle reproof. “Even reading a nice
Sunday book like the one Amy mentioned
may become a selfish amusement, if it
keeps us from adding a little to the general
pleasure.”</p>

<p>“I never knew Dora take such a reading
fit before,” muttered Lucius; “she
generally likes to use her fingers more
than her head.”</p>

<p>The remark was a very commonplace
one, yet it added to Dora’s confusion.
Mrs. Temple, noticing her daughter’s look
of annoyance, though she attributed it to
a different cause than the true one, turned
the conversation by asking Agnes whether
she had thought of a Scriptural type.</p>

<p>“Yes, mamma,” replied Agnes. “I believe
that leprosy is a type of sin, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
cure of lepers a type of the cure of sin
just as the looking up at the brazen serpent
was a cure for the deadly bites.”</p>

<p>“You are perfectly right, my dear girl,”
said her mother.</p>

<p>“What is leprosy?” asked little Elsie</p>

<p>“A dreadful kind of illness,” replied
Agnes; and as she seemed disinclined to
say more, perhaps from fear of bringing on
her cough by speaking, her mother continued
the description of this terrible type
of sin.</p>

<p>“This frightful malady is still well-known
in the East,” said Mrs. Temple.
“Your uncle, who came lately from India,
has told me that he has seen many poor
lepers there. The leprosy makes them
loathsome to the eye; it creeps over their
bodies; it wastes their flesh; when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
fastens on their hands, it will make the
very fingers drop off!”</p>

<p>“Oh, how dreadful!” exclaimed all the
children.</p>

<p>“Dreadful indeed, but not <i>so</i> dreadful
as the sin which it represents,” said their
mother sadly; “for the soul’s sickness is
more dangerous, its effects infinitely more
lasting.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite see how leprosy is a type
of sin,” observed Amy.</p>

<p>“I think that we are led to believe it to
be such by the very particular commands
regarding it which we find in the law of
Moses,” said Mrs. Temple.</p>

<p>“Did poor people with leprosy never
get well again?” asked Elsie, with pity expressed
on her round little face.</p>

<p>“Yes, they did sometimes recover,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
her mother, “but not by such means as
are used in cases of other sickness. Not
a doctor, but a priest, was to judge
whether the leper were really cured, or, as
it was called, <i>clean;</i> and he had to bring a
special offering to be sacrificed to the
Lord.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the offering was that sheep
which we see in the picture?” said Elsie,
for the illustrated Bible had again been
brought and placed upon Mrs. Temple’s
knee, and the firelight was sufficiently
bright to show a picture representing
a cured leper coming to the high-priest,
to find which illustration Mrs. Temple
had turned over the pages.</p>

<p>“That picture shows but a part of the
offering,” replied Mrs. Temple. “When
the candles come in, I will read to you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
from the ‘Pictorial History of Palestine,’
written by the famous Dr. Kitto, a description
of a very peculiar ceremony
which took place before the sheep and
two rams were slain as a sin-offering.”</p>

<p>“Ah! here come the candles—just when
we want them!” cried Elsie, as Eliza
made her appearance.</p>

<p>“I’ll get Dr. Kitto’s big book!” exclaimed
Lucius, jumping up from his seat
by the fire.</p>

<p>The candles were placed on the table
near enough to Mrs. Temple to enable her
to read without quitting her warm seat,
but merely turning her chair round to the
table. She then read aloud the following
extract from the work of the learned
doctor:</p>

<p>“‘When a person was reported to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
free of his leprosy, a priest went out of the
camp and subjected him to a very strict
examination. If no signs of the disorder
appeared upon him, the priest sent a
person to bring two living birds (doves or
young pigeons), cedar wood, scarlet wool,
and hyssop, with which he performed
the ceremonies of purification, to admit
the party to the privileges of the Hebrew
Church and communion.’”</p>

<p>“What does that mean, mother?” ashed
Lucius.</p>

<p>“That the man was no longer to be cut
off, as were lepers in Israel, from worshipping
the Lord within the camp, or mixing
with the rest of the people,” replied Mrs.
Temple.</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma, might not a poor leper
do that!” exclaimed Amy. “To be shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
out from praying with one’s friends and
relations would be almost the worst trial
of all!”</p>

<p>“Remember, my child, that the dreadful
disease was infectious; there was need
of the greatest care lest it should spread
in their camp. Lepers had to wear a
particular dress, and to live apart from all
who were yet in health. If any one drew
near to a leper unawares, the afflicted one
had to cry out ‘Unclean! unclean!’”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that I will ever again
complain of being shut up from friends
and playmates because of this whooping-cough,”
cried Lucius. “It is disagreeable
enough to be kept as we are even from
going to church, but fancy what it would
be to have to cry out ‘Unclean! unclean!’
if any one chanced to come near us!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“Please, mamma, go on with the account
of what the priest had to do with
the two birds which he sent for when he
found that the leper was quite well again,”
said Amy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple continued her reading:</p>

<p>“‘He slew one of the birds, and received
its blood in an earthen vessel. Into
this he dipped the cedar wood, the
scarlet wool, and the hyssop, and therewith
sprinkled seven times the once leprous
person. The other bird was then permitted
to escape, as a symbol that the
man was now free of his leprosy.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, how joyful the bird must have
been when allowed to fly free up—up high
into the air!” exclaimed Elsie.</p>

<p>“Not more glad than the poor cleansed
leper, of whom that bird was a type,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
observed Mrs. Temple. “Think of his
joy at being free to return to his family—his
wife and his children; and his thankful
delight when worshipping once more with
his former companions in the court of the
Tabernacle of his God!”</p>

<p>“It seems to me that there is a verse in
one of the Psalms which shows that
David had the cleansing of a leper in his
mind when he prayed to the Lord to
forgive him his sin,” remarked Lucius.</p>

<p>“I was just thinking of the same when
mamma read about the hyssop,” said
Amy. “It made me feel sure that Agnes
was right when she chose leprosy as a
type of sin.”</p>

<p>“What is the verse to which you
allude?” asked the mother.</p>

<p>Lucius was the one to reply, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
lips of Amy silently moved, as she repeated
the same verse to herself from the fifty-first
Psalm—“‘<i>Purge me with hyssop, and
I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be
whiter than snow!</i>’”</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma! I remember the story of
the poor leper who came to the Lord
Jesus,” said Elsie, “and how he cried,
‘<i>Lord if thou wilt, thou canst make me
clean!</i>’”</p>

<p>“How much more deeply interesting is
the Saviour’s reply, ‘<i>I will, be thou clean</i>,’
if we look upon leprosy as a type of sin,”
observed Mrs. Temple. “The Lord was
able and willing to heal, not the poor
man’s body alone, but also his soul; and
make him free from all stain of sin as well
as from all taint of disease.”</p>

<p class="drop-capi">“THE leper story which has always
interested me most is that of Naaman
the Syrian,” said Lucius,
when he had put back Dr. Kitto’s
large volume in its place in the bookcase.</p>

<p>“O yes, yes,” interrupted little Elsie;
“I know that story too, quite well. I
know that Naaman was a great man, and
rich, and a famous general besides, but he
had the dreadful sickness which no doctor
could cure. I remember how Naaman
came in a grand chariot with prancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
horses to the house of the good prophet
Elisha, and how angry he was when only
a servant came out and told him to wash
seven times in the river Jordan.”</p>

<p>Elsie stopped almost out of breath from
the rapidity with which she had spoken.
All the young Temples were familiar with
the account of the cure of the Syrian,
which was one of their favorite Scripture
stories.</p>

<p>“Was the leprosy of Naaman also a
type of sin?” inquired Lucius.</p>

<p>“I believe that it was,” answered Mrs.
Temple, “and I am strengthened in this
belief by Naaman’s leprosy coming upon
Gehazi, as a direct punishment for his
sin.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that wicked Gehazi!” exclaimed
Elsie; “he told a lie, a dreadful lie! It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
was right that he should be punished, was
it not?” The question was asked of
Dora, Elsie’s favorite sister. The child
wondered at the unwonted silence which
had come over Dora, and wanted to draw
her into conversing like the rest of the
party.</p>

<p>Dora winced at the question, and only
replied by a slight movement of her head.
But little Elsie was not satisfied by this.
“Why don’t you speak?” she said bluntly.
“When people are so very naughty as to
tell lies, and say that they are doing nothing
when they are doing something bad,
don’t you think that they ought to be well
punished for it?”</p>

<p>Forced to reply, for Elsie’s question had
drawn every one’s attention towards her,
Dora answered, “Of course they should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
punished;” and having thus pronounced
sentence upon herself, she relapsed into
silence, feeling much inclined, however, to
start up and escape from the room.</p>

<p>“Are you not well, my love?” asked
her mother, who could not help noticing
that Dora’s manner was different from
usual.</p>

<p>“Quite well, mamma; only a little
tired,” was the evasive reply.</p>

<p>“Tired of doing nothing,” said Lucius.</p>

<p>The conversation on the subject of Naaman
was then resumed by Agnes.</p>

<p>“When Naaman was cleansed of his
leprosy, mamma, how was it that Elisha
did not tell him to go and show himself to
the priest, and that we hear nothing about
a sin-offering, nor of a bird being set
free?” asked the elder twin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“You must remember,” replied Mrs.
Temple, “that Naaman was not an Israelite
but a Syrian, a Gentile, and that he
was therefore not bound to observe the
ceremonial law of the Jews. I think that
Naaman was a type of the Gentile church,
to which belong all Christians who are
not descended from Abraham and Isaac.”</p>

<p>“To which we then belong,” observed
Lucius.</p>

<p>“Notice, my children,” continued the
lady, “how we see, as if in a series of pictures,
the history of a converted soul in
the story of Naaman’s cure. First there
is the man possessing all that earth can
give him, but afflicted with a deadly disease.”</p>

<p>“Like the people who were bitten by
the fiery serpents,” interrupted Lucius.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here in the leprous Naaman we behold
a type or picture of a soul with unforgiven
sin staining and corrupting it,”
said his mother. “Next we find the leper
at the door of the prophet. Can any one
of you tell me of what Naaman now is a
type?”</p>

<p>“A seeking soul,” replied Agnes, after
a little pause for reflection.</p>

<p>“Ah! but the next picture is of the
leper turning away quite angry because he
was told just to wash and be clean,” cried
Elsie.</p>

<p>“Then Naaman is a type of a proud
soul, not content with God’s simple but
wonderful plan of salvation,” continued
the lady. “There are some persons now
who think that they can earn heaven by
doing some great thing, who believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
because of their own goodness they can be
clean in the sight of God. Such persons,
like Naaman, are offended and hurt when
they are told that all their good works
cannot take away sin; that the leper can
only be saved by living faith in Him
whose blood is the fountain opened for all
uncleanness.”</p>

<p>“But Naaman did go and dip down
seven times in Jordan as he was bidden,”
cried Elsie; “and then he was made
quite well, his flesh all soft and clean, just
like a little child’s.”</p>

<p>“This is a picture or type of a believing,
forgiven soul,” said Mrs. Temple,
“the picture of one who has become a
child of God, and who is resolved, by the
help of His Spirit, to lead from henceforth
a new life.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“These types are really beginning to be
quite plain to me now, mother,” said Lucius,
“and they make the Old Testament
seem to me to be very much more beautiful
than it ever seemed before. I remember
how puzzled I have been by some
words in one of the Epistles about the
rock which Moses smote in the desert,
and from which the waters gushed out.
St. Paul wrote ‘that Rock was Christ,’
and I never could make out what he
meant, for how could the rock be the
Lord? But now I understand, at least I
think that I do, that the Apostle meant
‘that smitten rock was a <small>TYPE</small> of Christ,’
and so everything becomes plain.”</p>

<p>“Some of our Lord’s own expressions
require to be explained in the same kind
of way,” observed Mrs. Temple. “When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
our Saviour declared that He was the
Vine, and his disciples the branches, it
was as if He had said, ‘A vine is a <small>TYPE</small>
of Me, and its branches a type of My
servants. <i>As the branch cannot bear fruit
of itself, except it abide in the vine, no more
can ye</i> (bear the fruits of holiness), <i>except
ye abide in Me.</i>’”</p>

<p>“And when the Lord said of the bread
at the last supper, <i>This is My body</i>, His
words must have meant that the bread
was a <small>TYPE</small> of His body,” said Amy with
thoughtful reverence. She was a lowly-hearted
girl, and she felt, as we all should
feel, that when so very sacred a subject as
the Lord’s sufferings or death is spoken
of by us, it is as if, through the opening
in the Tabernacle Veil, we were entering
into the Holy of holies.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">“CAN one object be a type of more
than one thing, mamma?” asked
Lucius, “for there is something
which we have just spoken of as
being a type of what heals our souls—I
mean by that, true living faith in the
Lord; and I have thought of something
quite different, of which it seems also a
type.”</p>

<p>“Are you speaking of the river Jordan?”
asked Agnes, through whose mind the
same thought had been passing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, the river in which Naaman dipped
seven times and was cleansed,” replied
Lucius. “When the Israelites, after their
long wanderings in the desert, came to
that same river Jordan, there was nothing
but its waters between them and the
Promised Land, which mother told me to-day
is a type of heaven.”</p>

<p>“And the waters were divided to let
the people pass over quite easily and
safely,” interrupted little Elsie, who never
missed an opportunity of bringing out any
knowledge which she had gleaned.</p>

<p>“Hush, Elsie! you distract my
thoughts,” said her brother, “and make
me forget with your prattle what I was
going to say. Oh, it is this! When
Christians have almost got over their long
life-journey, there is only one thing at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
that divides them from heaven, their
Promised Land; and that thing is death.
Mother, is not Jordan a type of death?”</p>

<p>“I believe that it is,” said his mother
and Amy silently thought of those beautiful
verses which allude to this type:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Oh! could we bid our doubts remove,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Those gloomy doubts that rise,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And view the Canaan that we love</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With Faith’s unclouded eyes;</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Could we but stand where Moses stood,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And view the landscape o’er,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;"><i>Nor Jordan’s stream, nor death’s cold flood,</i></span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Could fright us from the shore.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I also believe,” continued the lady,
“that the dividing of the waters, which
enabled the Israelites to pass over without
so much as wetting their feet, is a type of
the terrors of death being taken away
from the Christian. Safe through the
atoning sacrifice and happy in the love of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
his Lord, the believer can peacefully pass
on to his promised land—heaven—with as
little cause for fear as the Israelites had in
crossing the dry bed of the Jordan.”</p>

<p>“Ah! the Israelites were a happy
people,” said Amy, softly. “Think of
their having God always to guide them by
the pillar of fire and cloud, and holy Moses
always to pray for them; and the beautiful
promised land Canaan before them, and
so many wonderful miracles worked for
their good! I almost wish,” she added,
“that I had lived in those days.”</p>

<p>“Happier are Christians in these days,
my child,” said her mother, “for they
know more, far more, of the Saviour’s love
than was ever made known to the people
of Israel. We have God’s sure Word to
guide us in our wanderings through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
desert of life, and we have beyond that
desert a far brighter land than Canaan,
even heaven, promised and purchased by
Him who prepares good things for those
who love Him; and we have One far
greater than Moses—One who ever liveth
to plead for us at the right hand of God
while we fight our battles against sin.
Moses was a being of flesh and blood as
we are; his arms grew tired, he needed to
have them held up by Aaron and Hur;
but the Lord Jesus in praying for His
people never grows weary, and His love
never grows cold. My children, when life
was most like a desert to me, when your
father had crossed the Jordan and left me
behind, I cannot tell you what comfort
and support I found in the knowledge of
that prayer and the thought of that love!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Temple’s voice faltered, and Amy
felt the hand which she was clasping
tremble. The lady now very seldom gave
way to any outward burst of sorrow in
the presence of her children; her manner
was usually cheerful and bright; but the
elder ones could well remember how great
had been her grief in the first sad days of
her widowhood, when their father’s useful
life had been closed by a peaceful death.
The young Temples all respected their
mother’s sorrow, and when she paused
from emotion the room was so still that
the crackling of the fire and the tick of
the clock were the only sounds to be
heard. But Mrs. Temple was not willing
to throw even a brief shadow over the
cheerfulness of her little family circle, and
would not now have given way to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
feelings had not bodily weariness and
pain made her less able to control them.
Mrs. Temple very quickly recovered her
usual tone, and said in her wonted cheerful
manner, “My little Elsie’s eyes are growing
sleepy, she can hardly manage to
keep them open! My birdie had better
fly up to her snug warm nest, and prepare
by a good long rest for a busy to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, to-morrow will indeed be a
busy day!” exclaimed Lucius; “I mean
to be up with the lark. I hope, mother,”
he added, “that you won’t mind the noise
of my hammer?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple with a smile assured her
boy that she would not mind anything;
she had not been a mother so long without
becoming accustomed to noise, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
would be just as much interested in the
progress of the work of her children as
they themselves could be.</p>

<p>“You will like me to get on with my
little red curtains?” said Elsie, in rather
a drowsy tone.</p>

<p>A fond kiss was the mother’s reply;
and then Mrs. Temple herself took her
youngest child up to her bed-room, for
the lady always liked to hear Elsie repeat
her evening prayer.</p>

<p>About an hour afterwards all the other
young Temples had wished their mother
good-night, and retired to the several
apartments in which they slept. The
twins shared the same room. It was a
very pretty one, adorned with framed
pictures painted by their Aunt Theodora,
and lighted by candles in elegant green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
glass candlesticks, which had been a
birthday present to them from their
mother. Both the girls were, on the
night in question, more silent than usual,
but from different causes.</p>

<p>As Agnes sat slowly brushing out her
long plaits of brown hair, stopped every
now and then by her cough, her thoughts
dwelt much on the subject of the Israelites
and their journey through the wilderness,
which she was now taught to regard, not
only as a historical fact, but also as a type
of the life-journey of Christians.</p>

<p>Agnes was not by natural disposition
so merry and light-hearted as her brother
and sisters, and this difference between
her and the rest of the family was all the
more marked at the time of which I am
writing, from the health of the elder twin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
being a good deal shaken by her illness.
Agnes had naturally a peevish, passionate
temper, which greatly marred her own
peace of mind, and which prevented her
from winning much love from her young
companions. Agnes had many faults, and
she knew that she had them; they were
to her a trouble and burden. The young
girl honestly wished to get rid of and
conquer these faults, but she wanted
energy and spirit to make a really good
battle against her besetting sins. Agnes
was too much disposed to conclude that
because she was ill-tempered she must
always continue ill-tempered, that there
was no use in striving to subdue her evil
nature. Mrs. Temple’s elder twin was
wont to feel vexed and to look sullen
because Lucius never cared to sit and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
chat with her as he would with Dora; and
because Elsie never threw her arms round
her neck as she would round Amy’s. It
grieved Agnes to notice that no one ever
called her “pet,” or seemed to take
delight in having her near.</p>

<p>“I know that it is partly my own fault,”
Agnes would often say to herself, in
bitterness of soul; “but I don’t think that
if I were to leave home for months, there
is any one but mamma who would miss
me or want me back.”</p>

<p>Such thoughts had only the effect of
making the poor girl’s temper more cross,
and her manner more peevish; it is so
hard for the face to look bright and sweet
when gloom is within the heart.</p>

<p>But better thoughts were in the mind of
Agnes on that Sunday night, as she sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
silently brushing her hair. Sweet and
comforting was the reflection that she was
not left to fight her battle alone, that there
was One who would not only hear her
prayer, but who would Himself pray for
His feeble child—who would both watch
her struggle against sin, and give her
strength in that struggle. It was sweet to
poor Agnes, when she afterwards knelt
down to pray by the side of her bed, to
feel that if she was, like an Israelite, bitten
by the serpent of sin, she knew where to
look for a cure; that if she was like Naaman
the leper, there was the Fountain
open to her, in which she could wash and
be clean. Hope had sprung up in the
young girl’s heart, and with hope came increase
of courage. Agnes remembered
that the Lord who had supplied all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
need of the Israelites could supply hers
also; and when temptations assailed her,
as the enemy assailed that people, make
her also more than conqueror through the
power of His Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Very, very different were the thoughts
passing through the mind of Dora, though
outwardly she was doing exactly the same
things as were done by her twin sister.
Dora was <i>not</i> making a brave battle against
inward sin, but was, like a coward and
traitor, going over to the enemy’s side.
It is true that she still intended to unpick
on the Monday morning all that she had
sewn on the Sunday afternoon; but this
resolve was made on the false principle of
punishing herself for the sin she would not
honestly confess, and of which she had
never truly repented. This idea of self-inflicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
punishment was merely Dora’s
contrivance for quieting conscience, that
conscience which had been very uneasy
during the conversation on the subject of
leprosy, the terrible type of sin. But
Dora was trying, and with tolerable success,
to banish from her mind all thought
of that conversation. It was far more
pleasant to think of the pattern of the
Tabernacle curtains than of the holy
things of which that Tabernacle should
remind us.</p>

<p>A great many persons—even grown-up
persons—act, alas! like Dora. They so
fix their attention on outward things in
religion that they quite overlook the inward
meaning. Such self-deceivers are
ready enough to work at what pleases the
eye and amuses the fancy, and believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
they are making an offering to God; but
the cleansing of the heart, the giving up
sin—these are duties which they shrink
from, and which they willingly put off to
“a more convenient season.”</p>

<p class="drop-capi">ALMOST every inmate of Cedar
Lodge was up very early on Monday
morning, Agnes being the
only member of the family who
did not rise till her usual hour. The first
crow of the cock, strutting about in the
yard behind the house, roused little Elsie
from sleep. The child was restless and
impatient in her white-curtained cot, until
she was suffered to rise, dress, and set
about her Turkey-red work for the model.
Amy was bending over her strip of white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
linen almost before there was sufficient
light for her to see how to thread her fine
needle, for the morning was dark and
rainy; indeed the sun never showed his
face during the whole of that cheerless
day.</p>

<p>Drip, drip! fell the rain, but none of the
children regretted that they were not
likely to go out of the house. “I don’t
mind the rain one bit!” cried Elsie. “I’m
glad that it rains; we’ll get on so famously
with our work!”</p>

<p>Drip, drip! fell the rain; clink, clink!
fell the hammer of Lucius; and blithe
sounded his whistle, as he labored in the
midst of his squares of pasteboard, strips
of wood, and lengths of wire. The schoolboy
set to his work with a will; and how
pleasant is work when we have strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and spirit to do it, and feel that we have a
worthy object before us!</p>

<p>No one was up earlier than Dora. She
sprang from her bed before twilight had
given place to day-light, so impatient was
she to get to her embroidery pattern
again. The noise of Dora’s rising awoke
Agnes, who had not passed so good
a night as her more vigorous twin had
done, the sickly girl having been several
times disturbed by her cough.</p>

<p>“What are you about, Dora?” murmured
Agnes, in a drowsy and rather
complaining tone; “I’m sure that it can’t
be nearly time to get up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I like to set about my new work
quickly, and get a good piece of it done
before breakfast,” was Dora’s reply.</p>

<p>“There will be plenty of time for work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
between this and Christmas; I wish that
you would keep quiet and let me rest,”
yawned Agnes.</p>

<p>“You can rest if you wish it; I won’t
make a noise,” replied Dora. “But for
my part I like to be up and doing. You
know that:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Early to bed, and early to rise,</div>
<div class="verse">Is the way to be healthy, wealthy, and wise.’”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Agnes said nothing in contradiction of
the old proverb which her sister had
quoted, but turned round on her pillow,
and with a weary yawn composed herself
again to sleep. She thought that it
would be time enough to get up when
Susan should call her at a quarter to
seven, and she only wished that Dora had
thought so also, for it fidgeted Agnes to
hear her moving about in the room. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Dora had cared as little about disturbing
the sleep of a sickly sister as she had
about letting her mother go out in the
rain. Dora admired her own energy, and
looked upon Agnes almost with scorn, as
being lazy, cold, and dull, with not a bit
of enthusiasm in her nature.</p>

<p>“We should not have had a model
worth looking at had the embroidery been
left to her,” said Dora to herself, not without
a feeling of self-complacence, as she
glanced at her twin who had again sunk
into slumber.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Dora had
resolved to unpick all the work that she
had sewn upon the preceding Sunday.
As soon as the little girl had hastily
finished her toilet, so hastily that she
forgot to button her sleeves or put on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
collar, she opened her workbox, took out
her work, and seated herself as close to
the window as possible, in order to catch
as much as she could of the dim light of
dawn. It might have been expected that
Dora would also have forgotten to say her
prayers, but such was not the case. She
remembered to kneel down by her bedside
and hurry through a mere form of words,
without paying the slightest attention to
their meaning, thinking of her embroidery
all the time. It was a satisfaction to the
conscience of Dora that she had repeated
a prayer, and she never stopped to ask
herself whether that prayer were not in
itself a sin.</p>

<p>Dora with needle and scissors set first
to her work of unpicking. But every one
who has tried such an occupation must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
know it to be one of the most tedious and
disagreeable of tasks. It was doubly so
to Dora, because she greatly admired the
embroidery work which she was thus beginning
to spoil.</p>

<p>“It is a great pity to undo this,” Dora
said to herself before she had been for
two minutes plying the scissors. “I won’t
go on with this foolish unpicking. After
all, my undoing every stitch of my pretty
work would not undo the fault of my
having put it in on Sunday.”</p>

<p>This was indeed true. A fault once
committed, no human being has power to
undo; but while looking to the Lord alone
for forgiveness, we are bound to prove the
sincerity of our regret for a fault by making
what amends lie in our power. Dora
took the easier, but far more dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
way, of trying to forget the fault altogether,
or to make up for it by what she
considered to be her zeal in charity work.
She certainly sewed very diligently on
that dull morning, scarcely lifting her eyes
from the pattern which she had neatly
traced on the linen. She was filling up
the pencilled outlines with chain-stitch,
satin-stitch, and other stitches, in bright-colored
silks and a brilliant thread of
gold.</p>

<p>“Oh, look!—just look how famously
Dora has been getting on with her work!”
exclaimed the admiring Elsie, when, summoned
by the bell at half-past eight, the
children had assembled in the breakfast-room,
awaiting their mother’s coming
down to prayers.</p>

<p>“Why, you don’t mean to say that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
have worked all that this morning?” said
Lucius to Dora.</p>

<p>The question was rather an awkward
one for Dora to answer—it took the girl
by surprise. Dora replied to it by an
evasion, which was another act of deceit.
“I couldn’t begin my embroidery on
Saturday night,” she said, actually congratulating
herself that she had this time
spoken <i>the exact truth</i>, as if it were not the
very essence of falsehood to <i>deceive</i>, even
though the lips may utter no lie. As
Dora had not sewn on Saturday, she
knew that Lucius would take it for
granted that she had been so clever and
industrious as to do all the work which
he saw on the Monday morning, for he
would certainly never suspect her of having
put in one stitch upon Sunday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you admire Dora’s curtain, is it
not lovely?” said Amy to Agnes, who was
examining the work of her twin.</p>

<p>“Rather,” was the reply, uttered in a
hesitating tone.</p>

<p>Agnes could not truthfully have expressed
warmer admiration, for she did
not think that the figures of the cherubim
were at all gracefully drawn, nor did she
consider that the colors were perfectly
blended, there being too little scarlet in
proportion to the purple and blue. But
the cold praise of the twin was not
unnaturally set down by her family as
coming from a mean, unworthy motive.</p>

<p>“She is as jealous as a cat!” exclaimed
Lucius; “Agnes can’t forgive poor Dora
for having been trusted with the most
difficult part of the work.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>The irritable temper of Agnes fired up
in a moment at an observation which she
felt to be unjust as well as unkind. But
Agnes on that Monday morning had not
merely said her prayers, she had really
prayed for grace to conquer besetting sin,
and now, though she could not help her
cheeks flushing scarlet at the taunt of her
brother, she pressed her lips closely together,
and kept down the passionate
reply which it was so hard, so very hard,
not to utter.</p>

<p>“How much of your work have you
done this morning, Agnes?” asked Elsie,
rather proudly, showing her own three
inches of seam in the Turkey-red cloth.</p>

<p>“I have cut out my mohair curtains,”
said Agnes, who had also, though she did
not choose to say so, been mending her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
gloves, in obedience to the known wish of
her mother.</p>

<p>“Cut out—only cut out?” laughed
Lucius, who had been doing great things
in the nailing and hammering line; “if
you take the matter so easily, Agnes,
every one will <i>cut you out</i>, though you may
not be made into curtains!”</p>

<p>Agnes was provoked at the joke, and all
the more so because Dora and Elsie
laughed, and Amy could not help smiling.
Few persons like to be laughed at, and
the peevish-tempered Agnes was certainly
not one of the few. But the girl had
made a resolve, not in vain trust in her
own power of carrying it out, but in a
spirit of humble prayer, to set a watch
before her lips; and if she could not
speak kindly, not to utter a single word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Agnes could not, indeed, yet manage to
take a disagreeable joke with smiling
good humor, but she bore it in resolute
silence, she did not utter any retort.</p>

<p>No one admired Agnes Temple, no
one praised her self-command: she was
thought lazy because she had not eagerly
rushed into an occupation in which she
took no particular pleasure, and for which
she knew that she would find plenty of
time without neglecting more homely
duties; she was thought jealous because
she had simply spoken the truth; and yet
on that day Agnes had begun a nobler
work than that of embroidering in purple
and gold, and her offering was a far more
acceptable one than that of which Dora
was proud.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">“WHAT a busy, cheerful little party!”
exclaimed Mrs. Temple, as she
entered the study on the afternoon
of that same day, and found all
her children sitting together, sewing, cutting,
gilding, and chatting merrily as they
worked. “You remind me of the busy,
happy scene outside Jerusalem, beheld
every year when the Feast of Tabernacles
was kept.”</p>

<p>“What was the Feast of Tabernacles,
mamma?” inquired Amy. Lucius would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
have asked the same question, but he
dared not speak at that moment lest his
breath should blow away the sheet of
gold-leaf with which he was trying to cover
his wires.</p>

<p>“The Feast of Tabernacles was a yearly
festival held by the Israelites in remembrance
of the time spent by their fathers
in tabernacles or tents in the desert,”
replied the lady. “This was the most
cheerful of all the feasts, and was kept
in a remarkable manner. The people
made booths for themselves of the branches
of palm, willow, and other trees, and for
seven days lived in these booths. There
were processions, glad hosannas, and
sounds of singing and mirth. The people
enjoyed their out-of-door life, and blessed
the Lord for His goodness in guiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the Israelites through the wilderness to
the good land in which their children now
dwelt.”</p>

<p>“One could hardly keep such a feast in
England,” observed Agnes, glancing out
of the window at the gray sky and the
dripping trees, which were dimly reflected
in the pools left by the morning’s rain.</p>

<p>“I think that living in green leafy
booths would be delightful in summer,
even in England!” exclaimed Lucius, who
had managed to fix his gold-leaf. “I
should have liked, had I been a Jew, to
have kept the Feast of Tabernacles—better
perhaps than to have helped to make
this model Tabernacle,” added the boy,
who, after several hours of steady work,
was beginning to feel rather tired. “I
should much prefer hewing down branches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and doing the rough carpentering part of
the business, to gilding these tiresome,
fidgety wires, which I am sure to ungild
again as soon as I attempt to fix them into
their frame.”</p>

<p>“What, you are weary of your work
already!” exclaimed Dora, as she paused
in her sewing to thread her needle.</p>

<p>“Not exactly weary of it now,” answered
Lucius, “but I guess that I shall be so
long before this model is finished. It is
all very well,” he continued, taking up his
knife to hack away at some stubborn pasteboard—“it
is all very well to make pillars
and curtains while the sky is cloudy, and
the rain falls fast, and I am kept prisoner
at home; but suppose that the rain should
stop, and the sun shine out, and the weather
become settled at last, wouldn’t every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
one of us like running about in the fields
all day, playing at cricket, or croquet, or
rounders, better than measuring and cutting
and——there! snap goes my knife, my
new knife!” and with a gesture of impatience
the boy flung the unmanageable
pasteboard down on the table.</p>

<p>There was much to justify the suspicion
expressed by Lucius that the work so
eagerly begun by the Temples would, before
it could be finished, become a burden
and a tax upon the patience of all. On
the very next day began a season of
warmth and sunshine, which did more to
drive away coughs and restore vigor to
late invalids than could all the skill of the
doctor. Even Agnes was able to spend
hours in the open air; and, except at mealtimes,
Lucius liked to be out all the day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
His fidgety work, as he called it, could
scarcely be done but indoors, and the boy
found it a grievous task.</p>

<p>“But it would be a shame not to go on
with the model now, after putting mamma
to so much trouble and expense,” observed
Lucius one morning to Dora. “Besides,
I engaged to do it, and no English boy
must flinch back from keeping his word.
The new knife which I bought yesterday
is not to be compared to that which I so
unluckily snapped over the pasteboard;
but I must hack away steadily, and show
a good example to that lazy puss Elsie,
who since the fine weather began has not
put another stitch into her Turkey-red
curtains.”</p>

<p>“She has stowed them away in her
doll’s cradle,” observed Dora, laughing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Temple was not surprised to find
that the making of the model now progressed
more slowly; she was rather
pleased to see the amount of perseverance
shown by her children after the charm of
novelty had worn off. Even the “lazy
puss” drew her work from its hiding-place,
and would sew—for five minutes at
a time—“just to please dear mamma.”
All the five Temples continued to work,
when work had ceased to be an amusement;
but they worked from different
motives. Those which influenced Lucius—a
manly, honorable boy—have been
mentioned already, as well as the simple
wish to please mother which made Elsie
prick her plump little finger under her
Turkey-red cloth. But if you could glance
into the hearts of the three other girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
as they sit together industriously plying
their needles, we should find an example
of how the very same effect may be produced
by different causes.</p>

<p>Amy had from the very first considered
her humble work as something to be done
for her Heavenly Master, and this sweet
thought made her take pleasure in labor,
which without it would have been wearisome
indeed. It was this thought which
made Amy put fine hemming and stitching
into the long strips of white lawn which
represented the linen curtains surrounding
the court of the Tabernacle, and even
unpick any portion which did not seem to
her to be sewn neatly enough. Amy tried
to give her best, her very best work,
because she was giving it to the Lord, and
some of the happiest hours which the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
girl ever had known were spent over her
tedious curtains.</p>

<p>“I cannot think, Amy, how you can go
on so patiently with what is so tiresome,
with no variety in it, and a kind of work
which will not look striking when all is
done,” exclaimed Dora one day, as she
unrolled some glittering gold thread from
her reel.</p>

<p>Amy smiled as she glanced up at her
sister’s far more amusing occupation. “If
I could have worked anything so pretty as
the veil which you are making, I daresay
that I should have liked it much better,”
she observed. “But I am pleased to do
the plain work as well as I can, as the
embroidery would have been far too difficult
for me.”</p>

<p>Amy’s curtains might seem plain to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
eyes of most people, but her mother
looked upon them with special pleasure;
for, as she said to herself, “they are embroided
all over with faith and love.”</p>

<p>Agnes also made steady progress with
her not very inviting work, though she
took in it no great pleasure. Agnes
regarded the sewing as a matter of duty,
and therefore plied her needle in the same
spirit as that in which she struggled to
subdue her temper, and tried to put a
bridle on her tongue. It was the work
which had been given to her, and she
would do it, without asking herself whether
she liked it or not.</p>

<p>“This material, neither smooth nor
pretty, is something like a type of me,”
thought Agnes, as she put the finishing
stitch into one of her mohair curtains;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
“but the goats’-hair had just as much its
appointed place in the Tabernacle as loops
of silver and sockets of gold. I shall
never be as much liked and admired as
Dora is—I may as well make up my mind
to that; but if God help me by His grace,
I too may lead a useful life, and be dear—at
least to my mother.”</p>

<p>And more and more dear was Agnes becoming
to her mother, who watched with
the keen eye of affection the struggle made
by her eldest daughter against her besetting
sins. Mrs. Temple guessed what it
cost Agnes to bear a rough joke in silence,
to lend pretty things which she feared that
the borrower might spoil, to give up her
own way, and to show no jealous anger
when another was preferred before her.</p>

<p>“My girl’s character is becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
stronger and nobler every day,” thought
Mrs. Temple; “I thank the Lord for my
Agnes, for I am sure that it is His grace
that is working in her heart. Agnes promises
to grow up into a really valuable
woman, one whom her mother can trust.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple could not have said as
much for her dearly loved Dora. The
lady was perplexed and pained to feel
that something—she knew not what it
could be—seemed to have come between
her and her bright, clever, affectionate
child. Dora, indeed, gave Mrs. Temple
no cause to find fault with her conduct;
her lessons were well learned, her temper
was good, she was a favorite still with her
brother and sisters; and yet her mother
felt that there was a change in her Dora
for which she could not account. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Temple was wont to have little quiet conversations
separately with each of her
children at night: in these meetings they
were able to open their hearts more freely
to their mother than they could have done
had a third person been present, and their
parent could speak upon religious subjects
in the way best suited to the character
and age of each. These quiet moments
spent alone with mamma had been greatly
prized by all the children; but Dora could
take pleasure in them no more, and her
parent was conscious that such was the
case. The girl generally managed, only
too easily, to forget all about her unrepented
sin when the remembrance of it was
not forced upon her now half-deadened
conscience, but when her mother sat by
her bedside and softly talked to her about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
heaven, Dora grew uneasy in spirit. She
did not like to be reminded of the holy
God whose law she had broken—what
pleasure could the knowledge of His truth
bring to one who was conscious of unrepented
falsehood! The returns of Sundays,
nay, even the hour for family prayer, were
never welcome to Dora. When she repeated
texts or hymns, as the rest of the
family did, she had the wretched consciousness
that she was acting a hypocrite’s
part, and taking God’s name in
vain. Dora’s life was becoming one long
act of deceit. She was secretly ashamed
of herself for appearing so much better
than she in reality was.</p>

<p>“But my work—my beautiful work—my
work for the poor—I’ll make up for what
I’ve done wrong by taking extra pains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
with that!” thought Dora. And so the
poor girl usually succeeded in winning
much praise from others, and in deceiving
her own sinful heart, only too willing to
be thus deceived.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">“THERE is one thing which we
can’t do, it is too hard for even
Dora,” observed Elsie one morning
at breakfast, when, as was
often the case, the Children’s Tabernacle
had formed a topic of conversation. “We
can’t make models of the Ark, or the
Altar, or the Table of Showbread; our
pretty curtains won’t cover anything, the
Tabernacle will be quite empty!”</p>

<p>“I really could not undertake to do
more than I am doing, even if my fingers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
could manage to make such tiny models,”
said Lucius, who, as we have seen, already
found that he had engaged in a difficult
task.</p>

<p>Agnes, Dora, and Amy were silent; they
all felt that there would certainly be a
great want in their Tabernacle, but they
did not see how that want could possibly
be supplied.</p>

<p>The young Temples little guessed that
while their mother was in her own
room, engaged, as they supposed, in reading
or writing, or making up her household
accounts, she was preparing for them a
pleasant surprise. Mrs. Temple was not
less with her family than usual, she did
not neglect her house affairs, she never
forgot either to order the dinner or to pay
the butcher and baker, but she stole time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
for her novel employment from her sleep,
and from her favorite amusement of reading
library books.</p>

<p>On the day when the model was completed,
when the last silver socket had
been fastened, and the last little curtain
hemmed, the children had the pleasure of
setting up the Tabernacle in the study,
to see how it looked. There was great
satisfaction in surveying the finished
work; every one felt glad that the long
labor was over, and that he had had a
share in the work.</p>

<p>“How pleased auntie will be!” cried
Elsie.</p>

<p>“And the ragged children, too,” joined
in Amy.</p>

<p>“And now go out for your walk, my
dear ones,” said their mother; “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
morning is so frosty and bright that you
may make your walk a long one; I should
not be surprised should you wander as
far as Burnley woods. I shall not expect
you back for a couple of hours.”</p>

<p>“Mother, you will go with us,” said
Lucius.</p>

<p>“I will be particularly engaged this
morning,” replied Mrs. Temple, as she
shook her head with a smile. Elsie remarked
afterwards that it had been “a
knowing kind of smile,” as if there had
been some very particular reason indeed
for her mamma’s stopping at home. The
reason was clear enough to all the party
when they returned from their walk, and
with their cheeks rosy from the fresh air
and exercise re-entered the study. The
children found their mother standing beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the model. Elsie, who was the first
to run up to it, gave almost a scream of
delight.</p>

<p>“Oh! see—see what mamma has been
making! Clever mamma!” she cried,
clapping her hands, and jumping for joy.</p>

<p>“What lovely little models!” exclaimed
Lucius. “Mother, it is you who have
cut us all out.”</p>

<p>“You have done what none of us could
have done,” said Agnes.</p>

<p>“And so quietly too,” observed Dora.</p>

<p>“There is nothing wanting now!” cried
Amy, putting her arm fondly around the
parent who had so kindly entered into the
little pleasures of her children.</p>

<p>“I thought that one thing more was
wanting,” said Mrs. Temple. The lady
seated herself beside the table, and took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
off the cover of a little pasteboard box
which she held in her hand. The children
looked on with mingled curiosity and
pleasure as their mother carefully drew
out from it a beautiful little figure about
two inches long, exquisitely dressed in
miniature garments, representing those
which were worn by the high-priest of
Israel. To imitate these garments in a
size so small, had taxed the utmost skill
of the ingenious and neat-fingered lady.</p>

<p>I need not set down all the exclamations
of wonder and pleasure which were
uttered by the younger Temples. If their
mother’s great object had been to gratify
her children, that object was certainly
attained.</p>

<p>“The dress which I have tried to
imitate,” said the lady, “is that in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the high-priest appeared on solemn occasions.
The Day of Atonement was, however,
an exception; on that most solemn
day in the year, when the high-priest
ventured into the Holy of holies, he did
so in simple garments of pure white linen.”</p>

<p>The mother then showed and explained
to her family the different articles of
dress on her curious model. The under-tunic,
or shirt, of linen, and above it the
mantle of sky-blue color, having at the
bottom an ornamental border or fringe.</p>

<p>“This fringe, which, as you see, I have
cut out in the form of tiny pomegranates,
ought to be interspersed with bells of
gold,” said Mrs. Temple; “but my fingers
could not succeed in making anything so
very minute.”</p>

<p>“And unless we had looked through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
microscope, we could not have distinguished
bells no bigger than needles’
eyes,” observed Lucius.</p>

<p>“And what is this fine uppermost garment,
reaching to the knees?” inquired
Dora, looking admiringly on the delicate
embroidery in gold and colors similar to
that which she had herself worked for the
Veil, only a great deal finer.</p>

<p>“This is the Ephod,” replied Mrs. Temple.
“On the front of it I have, as you
see, worked in very small beads of
various colors an imitation of the high-priest’s
breastplate, which was formed of
twelve precious stones.”</p>

<p>The minute breastplate excited more
attention than any other part of the
high-priest’s dress, and had, perhaps,
given the skilful worker more trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
than all the rest. Every one of the little
beads was of a different tint. They were
closely set together in rows, so as to form
a square ornament, and were fastened to
the shoulder parts of the Ephod by little
threads of gold.</p>

<p>“How very splendid the real breastplate
must have been!” exclaimed Dora Temple.</p>

<p>“Had it also some typical meaning?”
asked Lucius. “I suppose so,” he added,
“as everything about the Tabernacle and
the high-priest seems to have been a type
of something greater.”</p>

<p>“On each of the precious stones in the
splendid breastplate was inscribed the
names of one of the twelve tribes of Israel,”
replied Mrs. Temple. “I believe that the
breastplate was worn by the high-priest,
who was to pray in the Tabernacle for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
people, and then to come forward and
bless them, as a token that he bore their
names on his heart.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is a beautiful meaning!”
cried Amy; “especially when we think,”
she continued, more softly, “that the
high-priest was a type of our blessed
Saviour Himself.”</p>

<p>“Who bears all His people’s names on
his heart,” observed Mrs. Temple; “both
when He pleads for them in heaven, and
when He blesses them upon earth.”</p>

<p>“The high-priest must have looked very
noble and grand in his rich garments,”
observed Lucius; “and yet it seems too
much honor for any mere man to be called
a type of the Son of God.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my boy! poor and mean indeed
must any earthly type appear when compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
to the heavenly Antitype!” exclaimed
Mrs. Temple. “That thought came
strongly to my mind as I was sewing
together these little worthless glass beads
to form the model of the glorious breastplate.
‘Can these wretched little atoms
of colored glass,’ I said to myself, ‘give
any idea of magnificent jewels, sparkling
in light, set in gold, and each engraved
with a name?’ But even so mean, and
small, and insignificant was Aaron, in all
his splendor, compared to the sacred
Being who deigns to call Himself our
High-Priest, and to make intercession for
us above!”</p>

<p>All the party were silent for several
moments, looking down at the little model,
and thinking over the words of their
mother. Elsie then pointed to the curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
head-dress which appeared on the figure.
It was not exactly a turban, though it was
formed of tight rolls of linen. It had the
representation of a plate of gold in front,
fastened on to it by a blue thread.</p>

<p>“That head-dress is called the high-priest’s
bonnet or mitre,” observed Mrs.
Temple. “There are rather different
opinions regarding its exact shape. It
cost me a good deal of thought to contrive
it, and here again I felt how impossible it
is to give anything like a just idea of the
real object in a model so small as this.
You see that I have not neglected to put
a little gold plate on the front of the
mitre; but I had no power to form letters
so minute as to represent on it what was
engraved on that which the high-priest
wore. This was ‘<span class="smcap">Holiness to the Lord</span>.’”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then the high-priest had the Lord’s
Name written over his brow,” observed
Agnes. “It makes one think of the promise
in the Bible, that saints in heaven
shall have His Name written on their
foreheads.” (Rev. xxii. 4.)</p>

<p>“All will be ‘<i>Holiness to the Lord</i>’ in
that happy place!” observed Amy.</p>

<p>It was pleasanter to Dora to examine
the little model before her, and to admire
and praise her mother’s skill, than to think
of what was inscribed on the mitre worn
by Aaron and his successors. It is the
sad, sad effect of sin concealed in the heart,
that it keeps those who indulge it from
daring even to <i>wish</i> to be holy.</p>

<p>The Tabernacle was now carefully taken
down, piece by piece, to be packed in a
box, ready to be carried along with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
rest of their luggage when the family
should quit their home for awhile. Every
curtain was neatly folded, and all the
pillars carefully wrapped up in paper.
The figure representing the high-priest
was gently put back into its own little box,
and all the other little objects were packed
in cotton, so as to bear without injury a
little jolting on the journey before them.</p>

<p>With additional pleasure the young
Temples now looked forward to the coming
Christmas season, and the long-expected
visit which they were to pay to their Aunt
Theodora.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">SEVERAL months have passed away
since the Temples began making
their model of the Tabernacle of
Israel. The leaves which were
then green on the trees, have become
yellow, have faded and fallen; save those
on the evergreens, which wear a silver
crusting of frost. But it is not to Cedar
Lodge that I shall take my young readers,
but to a large and rather plain brick house
in the city of Chester. It is a house by no
means beautiful to the eye, and its only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
look-out is into a narrow paved street;
but still that house has a charm of its own,
it is dear to many a heart, for its owner,
Miss Theodora Clare, is the friend and
benefactress of the poor around. Many
have entered sadly through the dark green
door of that red-brick house, who have
left it cheerfully, blessing the kind heart
and liberal hand of its lady.</p>

<p>It is just two days before Christmas:
on the morrow Miss Clare’s Ragged School
is to have its annual treat. A feast and
gifts of warm socks or mittens knitted for
each child by the lady’s own hands, are
not to form the only, or perhaps the chief
attractions of the treat; the little scholars
have been promised a sight of the model
Tabernacle, which its young makers are
to bring from their country home, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
ten miles away. Christmas Eve has been
fixed upon by Miss Clare as the time for
her Ragged School Fête, because it is
the birthday of her twin nieces, the younger
of whom is her namesake. The arrival
of the Temple family is expected almost
every minute, and Miss Clare sits by the
window, with the red glow of a December
sun upon her, glancing up with a look of
pleasant expectation whenever she hears
the rattle of wheels along the narrow
paved street. You might guess at once
by the likeness between them that Miss
Clare is the sister of Mrs. Temple, though
her figure is a little taller, and her locks a
little whiter than those of the widow lady.</p>

<p>Miss Clare is evidently thinking; she
looks a little perplexed and doubtful as
she examines the contents of a large old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
ebony box which holds her little
treasures. Not treasures of silver or
gold; there are but few indeed of such
things in the possession of Theodora
Clare: her silver spoons have fed the
hungry; her gold chain has paid for the
benches on which her ragged scholars sit,
and her bracelets for the books which
they learn from, and the big blackboard
on the wall. A good many pairs of stout
little shoes have come out of Miss Clare’s
silver tea-pot! But there is one article
of jewellery which the lady still possesses,
and this is to her the most precious of all.
It is the likeness of her sister, Mrs. Temple,
in a brooch, set round with pearls.
This was the gift of Mr. Temple on his
wedding-day to the bridesmaid, Theodora;
it is very beautiful as an ornament, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
a likeness almost perfect. But not even
this jewel does the generous lady intend
to keep for herself; it is to be her birthday
present on the following day to Dora.</p>

<p>Miss Clare has for years settled in her
own mind that her god-daughter should
receive the precious brooch on completing
the twelfth year of her age; it is no doubt
upon this subject that perplexes her now;
(for the lady does look a little perplexed
as she searches her old-fashioned box for
something which she seems to have some
difficulty in finding). She opens this little
packet, then that little packet, then silently
shakes her head, or murmurs “No, that
will not do,” as she replaces it in the large
box. The reader knows that Dora has a
twin sister, and that the birthday of the
one is also the birthday of the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Miss Clare does not like to give to Dora
without also giving to Agnes, and as her
hospitality and her charities leave her
very little money for buying presents, she
wishes to find some suitable article already
in her possession of which to make a
birthday remembrance. But what should
that article be? Almost everything that
would please a young girl had already
been given away.</p>

<p>“I have nothing—nothing that can be
compared in value or in beauty with the
brooch,” said Miss Clare to herself, as
she locked the box where she had been
vainly searching amongst locks of hair
neatly wrapped in separate papers, old
letters, and little pictures faded and yellow
with time. “I hope that Agnes is too
sensible a girl to expect that my precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
brooch should be given to herself instead
of to my namesake, who is to me almost
as a daughter; but still Agnes is the elder
of the twins; she is, I fear, of rather a
jealous temper; her character has not—or
had not a year ago—the generosity and
sweetness of that of my Dora. I should
be grieved to hurt the feelings of either
of the dear girls; what can I find that
will really please Agnes?”</p>

<p>Miss Clare had really given the subject
a good deal of consideration, though
apparently to little purpose, when a
thought occurred to her mind which
brought a smile of satisfaction to her kind
pleasant face. Miss Clare rose from her
seat by the window, and went to a table
which had in it a drawer, hidden by the
neat brown cloth that hung over the sides.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
The lady lifted the cloth, drew open the
drawer, and then took from it a flat parcel
wrapped in a peculiar kind of yellowish
paper, with that scent about it which usually
pervades articles which have come
from India.</p>

<p>“Here is the delicate little embroidered
neck-scarf which was sent to me years
ago, and which I have always thought
much too fine for my wear,” said the lady,
as she opened the parcel. “This will of
course be a gift not to be compared to the
brooch; but still it is pretty, very pretty;
I think that Agnes is sure to admire it.”</p>

<p>It was indeed impossible not to admire
the exquisite embroidery in gold and
colors on the small India-muslin scarf.
The natives of India excel in this kind of
work, and the little scarf was a gem of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
beauty for richness of pattern and brightness
of hue. Miss Clare’s only doubt was
whether such an article of dress were not
too gay to be given to her young niece.</p>

<p>Miss Clare had little time to think over
this matter, for hardly had she put back
the pretty piece of embroidery into its
paper wrapping, and then replaced it in
the drawer, when the rattle of wheels was
heard on the stones, and a large carriage,
well filled within, and with plenty of luggage
without, was driven up to the door.
Well Miss Clare knew the smiling eager
faces which crowded the carriage window,
and the merry young voices which sounded
through the clear cold winter air. The
lady ran hurriedly to meet and welcome
the party, and was at the open door, notwithstanding
the cold of frosty December,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
before Mrs. Temple and her five children
could manage to get out of the carriage
in which they had been too closely packed
for comfort, but in which they had been
very noisy and merry. All trace of
whooping cough had long since departed,
and the sounds which had been heard in
the carriage had been only those of talking,
laughing, and singing!</p>

<p class="drop-capi">“MIND, coachman, mind! You must
hand down that box very carefully!”
shouted out Lucius to the
driver, who was now engaged in
taking down the luggage. The boy had
been the first of the party to spring out
of the carriage, but he was the last to
enter the house, for all his thoughts
seemed to be taken up by the long, flat
deal box which had been put under the
special care of the coachman, with many
a charge to see that no harm should come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
to it on the journey. Had the box been a
cradle containing a baby, it could hardly
have been more gently and carefully
received from the coachman’s hands, and
then carried up the door-steps and into
the red-brick house by Lucius. Did it
not hold the result of the labor of many
weeks!—was there not in it the work
completed by the family’s united efforts,
the beautiful model of the Tabernacle
made by the children of Israel!</p>

<p>“Oh, auntie, here is our great work—our
model! Where shall we set it up?
Have you a table ready? It is all
finished—every loop! Oh, you must see
it! you must see it!” Such were the
exclamations which burst from the children
as Lucius appeared in the hall,
laden with the long, flat deal box.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Clare had not yet seen the model,
though she had heard a great deal about
it, and had given notice to many friends
and neighbors of the little exhibition of
it,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> to be held in her house through the
following week, for the benefit of her
school. She was amused at the eager
impatience shown by the youthful workers.
Except Agnes, who took the matter more
quietly, none of the Temples cared even
to warm themselves by the blazing fire
after their wintry journey until the model
Tabernacle had been unpacked from its
box.</p>

<p>“Please, auntie, please don’t look at it
till it’s all set up!” exclaimed Elsie, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
tone of entreaty. “You can talk to
mamma, you know, while we are unrolling
the little curtains (I did the Turkey-red
curtains)—and fastening them up on the
gilded pillars by the wee wee loops which
are made of silver thread!”</p>

<p>Miss Clare was quite willing to indulge
the humor of her young guests, so that
she did not even remain in the room while
the Tabernacle was being put up on
the table set apart for the purpose. She
took her sister, Mrs. Temple, up-stairs,
and helped her to take off her cloak and
furs, and talked over many subjects with
her, while the young people below were
busily engaged with their model. It was
not until nearly two hours had elapsed,
and after the party had all partaken
of a dinner of roast beef and plum-pudding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
that Miss Clare re-entered her own
sitting-room to have her first sight of the
wonderful work.</p>

<p>For wonderful it was in the eyes of its
youthful contrivers, who knew the trouble
which it had cost them to finish and fix
those numerous pillars and curtains, with
sockets and loops. The Temples regarded
their model as a triumph of art and
patience, much as the builder of one of
the Pyramids may have regarded his own
gigantic work. Miss Clare was expected
to look and feel a good deal more
astonished than she could in sincerity do;
but if she was not astonished, at least she
was pleased, and showed that she was so.</p>

<p>“It’s a pity, auntie, that you can’t see
more of my Turkey-red curtains; I wish
they’d been the top ones,” cried Elsie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
lifting up a corner of the merino covering
to show her own work beneath.</p>

<p>“These linen curtains round the court of
the Tabernacle are neatly, very neatly
made,” observed Miss Clare; “with so
many silver loops they must have required
a great deal of patience in the
worker.”</p>

<p>Amy colored with pleasure at the
praise; she had not expected her own
share of the work to attract much notice.
She now silently drew her aunt’s attention
to the pretty little gilded pillars upon
which her curtains were hung.</p>

<p>“But the beauty part—the real beauty
part—is the ’broidery, the inner curtains,
and the veil!” exclaimed Elsie. “Oh,
auntie, you will be astonished at them.
Just stoop down and look in—just look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
in! We’ve managed to leave the front
open, and the veil is half-drawn aside, so
that you can see the inner part quite well.
No one could see the inner part of the
real Tabernacle, you know; but then ours
is only a model.”</p>

<p>The lady stooped, as requested, and
looked through the space between the
front pillars, not only into the outer Tabernacle,
but beyond the veil into what, in
the model, represented the Holy of holies.
Dora, who had for months been looking
forward to this moment, listened eagerly
to hear what her darling aunt would say
of her work.</p>

<p>Miss Clare, it will be remembered, had
that day been examining a lovely specimen
of some of the most finished embroidery
to be found in any part of the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Dora’s work was clever, regarded as that
of a girl not twelve years of age, who had
had to contrive her own pattern; but it
was, of course, very poor compared to that
on the Indian scarf.</p>

<p>“Is it not splendid ’broidery?” persisted
Elsie, who wished others to share her own
unbounded admiration for the work of a
favorite sister.</p>

<p>“It is nice,” said Aunt Theodora, quietly,
“but wants a little more scarlet, I think.”</p>

<p>And was this all that could be said of
that which had cost Dora hours of thought,
and many hours of patient labor—these
few words of qualified praise! Dora was
bitterly disappointed, far more disappointed
than Agnes, whose curtains, whether
mohair or merino, seemed to win no
notice at all. There was good reason why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Dora should feel pain which Agnes was
spared. It was not time and labor only
which the younger twin had given to gain
success; she had made a sacrifice of conscience,
she had forfeited her own self-respect,
she had lost the blessing of confidential
intercourse with her mother, and
all pleasure and comfort in prayer! Dora
had given up all this, and for what? To
hear the observation, by no means unkindly
uttered, “It is nice, but wants a
little more scarlet.”</p>

<p>If Dora had ever believed that in working
her embroidery she had really been
laboring for anything higher than earthly
pleasure or human praise, the extreme
vexation which she now experienced must
surely have undeceived her. Why should
she care so much for what was said of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
her performance if her real object was but
to please her Heavenly Master? Agnes
and Amy, who had worked from motives of
duty and love, were safe from any such
keen disappointment. They both looked
with pleasure on the completed model, in
forming which they had taken inferior
parts; while Dora had to walk to the
window to hide from the eyes of her
family the mortification which she felt.</p>

<p>That day was a very happy one to all
the members of the Temple family, Dora
alone excepted. She felt a kind of dread
of the evening conversation which she knew
that she would have with her aunt. The
eve of her last birthday Dora remembered
as, perhaps, the happiest time of her life.
Aunt Theodora had come to sit with her,
and talk to her of her coming birthday—a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
new milestone, as she called it, on the
pilgrim’s path towards heaven. Dora had
on that evening opened her heart to her
aunt, and the two had loved each other
more fondly than they ever had loved
before, and their parting embrace had
been so sweet that Dora had felt that
she could never forget it. Miss Clare was
certain to come again this evening into
her room—in this house Dora had a little
room to herself—and must the niece act
the hypocrite’s part to an aunt so loving
and true; must the girl so trusted and
loved make a show of openness while
concealing a secret from her aunt, which,
if confessed, must lower her in the eyes
of that tender relative and friend?</p>

<p>Miss Clare did indeed come that night,
as Dora had expected that she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
come. The girl soon found herself sitting
on a stool with her arms resting on her
aunt’s knee, as they had rested twelve
months before; and she heard the same
dear voice speaking to her of holy things,
as she had heard on that well-remembered
night. The room was the same, the
furniture, the pictures were all the same,
but Dora felt in her own heart a miserable
change. Half a dozen times was the poor
girl on the point of laying her head on her
aunt’s knee, and sobbing forth a full confession
to relieve her burdened heart. But
to own repeated falsehood and long deceit
to one herself so truthful, to lose the good
opinion of one whose regard she so greatly
valued, oh! Dora could not muster up
courage sufficient for this!</p>

<p>“And now that you are making a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
start in life’s journey, my child,” such
were the aunt’s concluding words as she
rose to depart, “give yourself anew to the
best of Masters, the most tender of
Friends. Ask His blessing upon all that
you do: without that blessing our best
works are but like building on sand, or
writing on water—all end in vanity and
vexation of spirit. The great lesson taught
us by the history of ancient Israel is this:
the path of obedience is the path of safety
and happiness also. When God’s people
followed where He led, and did what He
commanded, then were their hearts filled
with joy, and their harps tuned to glad
songs of triumph; but when the Israelites
turned aside to paths of disobedience,
sorrow followed close upon sin; they
hung their harps on the willows, and, exiles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
from their beautiful land, they wept when
they remembered the blessings which
would still have been theirs, had they not
forsaken their God!”</p>

<p class="drop-capi">The birthday of the twins had
arrived; but the sun rises late on
the twenty-fourth of December,
and Dora was up, dressing by
candlelight, long before his first beams
shone on the sheet of pure white snow
which had fallen during the night. It
might be supposed that Dora’s thoughts
would be on the words of advice which she
had heard on the previous night; but
though these words had made some impression
at the time, it was by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
upon them that the girl’s mind was running
when she awoke in the morning.
Dora was thinking of her embroidery work—that
work of which she had been so
proud, that work which had cost her so
dear. Nothing that Miss Clare had said
dwelt so much on the memory of her niece
as the simple observation, “It wants a
little more scarlet, I think.”</p>

<p>For on the mantelpiece of the room now
occupied by Dora, there chanced to stand
a glass bottle, corked and labelled; and
by the light of her candle Dora had noticed
that “<small>SCARLET INK</small>” was printed
upon the label. The sight of that little
bottle had roused in the mind of the girl
new hopes, and again turned her energies
into the channel of work.</p>

<p>“My supply of scarlet silk ran short,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
and I was not able to get another skein at
the shop,” thought Dora. “Aunt is quite
right, there is not enough of scarlet mixed
with the purple and blue; it is that which
spoils the effect of my curtains. I wonder
that no one noticed that before! But I
have a skein of white silk with me, and why
should I not dye it myself with that beautiful
scarlet ink? This is a capital idea!
The school children do not come till the
afternoon; I should have time to dye my
silk before breakfast, and after breakfast
to work enough scarlet into my pattern to
give a brilliant effect to all that part which
is most easily seen. How pleased Aunt
Theodora will be to find that I have taken
her hint, and that I grudge no extra
trouble to make my work complete!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
How very lucky it is that she put that ink
into my room!”</p>

<p>Dora actually forgot both her prayers
and her Scripture reading on that birthday
morning, in her impatience to get down-stairs
and quietly remove her inner veil
and curtains from the model, before any
other member of the family should enter
the room where it was kept. With rough
hair, and dress only half-buttoned, Dora
noiselessly opened her door, and then
crept down the staircase, and into the
sitting-room in which the Tabernacle
stood, covered from the dust by large
sheets of silver paper. There was no one
in the room except the housemaid, who
was employed in opening the shutters
to let in the light of morning.</p>

<p>The model, as we know, was made to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
taken to pieces at will; but as Dora’s set
of curtains was the innermost of all, it
cost her some time and trouble to remove
them. She pursued her occupation, while
the housemaid went on with that of lighting
the fire and dusting the room, and
was at last able to disengage the whole of
the embroidered portion of the drapery of
the little Tabernacle. With this Dora returned
to her own apartment, and she laid
her work on the pretty little table which
her aunt had placed for her convenience.</p>

<p>“I must be quick about the dyeing,”
said Dora to herself, “for I can hear
Lucius whistling up-stairs in the passage,
and little Elsie running about in the room
just over my head. The family is now all
astir, and in a quarter of an hour the
prayer-bell will ring. If I don’t dye my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
silk scarlet at once I shall be sadly delayed
in my work, for I cannot, of course, use it
for sewing until it is perfectly dry.”</p>

<p>So Dora took the bottle of ink down
from its place on the mantelpiece, and in
a great hurry set about removing the
sealing-wax which covered the cork, for
the bottle had not yet been opened. It
was a tolerably easy matter to break off
the edges of the red wax, but Dora did
not find it easy at all to pull out the cork,
which was low in the narrow neck of the
bottle, and happened to be a very tight
fit.</p>

<p>“Dear! dear! how troublesome this is!”
exclaimed Dora, hunting about for her
stout pair of nail scissors to help her in
forcing out the obstinate cork.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Dora dear, many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
happy returns of the day to you!” cried
the merry voice of Elsie, as she tapped at
the door of her sister.</p>

<p>“Thank you, darling, don’t come in
now; I’ll soon be down-stairs—I’m not
quite ready!” called out Dora, who had
just succeeded in finding the scissors.
She heard the little feet patter down the
stairs.</p>

<p>“Happy birthday to you, Dora! Mind
you’re not late, Miss Twelve-years-old!”
This time it was the voice of Lucius at
the door.</p>

<p>“No, no, I’ll not be late; I’ll be down
in ten minutes!” cried Dora, digging her
scissors vigorously into the cork. The
clatter of Lucius’s boots showed that he
had followed little Elsie.</p>

<p>“Oh, this cork, this tiresome cork!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
exclaimed Dora; “there, it’s out at last;”
and setting the opened bottle on the
table, she turned round in a great flurry
to get from her box the skein of silk
which was to be changed from white
to scarlet.</p>

<p>“More haste, less speed.” Dora was
not the first who has proved the truth of
that proverb. She whisked round so
rapidly that her dress struck the top of the
bottle which she had carelessly set down
in a place that was not very safe. The
bottle was knocked over, but it fell upon
something soft which lay on the table, so
that it was neither broken, nor did it
make enough noise in falling to attract the
attention of Dora. It was not till she
had found the skein (which she had some
trouble in doing), that on turning back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the table she perceived the mischief
caused by her hasty movement.</p>

<p>What a start and exclamation of distress
were given by poor Dora when she
saw on the table her embroidery lying
actually under the overturned bottle, and
soaked through and through with the
scarlet ink which had flowed in abundance
from it!</p>

<p>Dora stood for a moment as if rooted
to the spot, scarcely able to believe her
own eyes. She then darted forward,
caught up the half-emptied bottle in one
hand, and the stained, dripping linen in
the other. The first glance at the embroidery
showed the poor girl that the
mischief done was utterly beyond repairing;
in one minute the fruit of all her long
toil had been completely destroyed!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, it is all my own fault—all my own
fault—it could not have prospered!” cried
out Dora, in a loud tone of anguish, as
she put down first the bottle, then the
embroidery, and then, hiding her face
with her scarlet-stained fingers, she burst
into a passion of weeping.</p>

<p>That cry, that weeping, reached the
ears of her aunt, who had just approached
her door, carrying with her the destined
gifts for the twins—the Indian scarf, and
the brooch with the miniature set in
pearls.</p>

<p>“My darling girl, what is the matter?”
exclaimed Miss Clare, opening the door in
alarm. There was no need to repeat the
unanswered question; the bottle, the little
heap of embroidered linen dripping with
scarlet ink, told their own story plainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
enough. Miss Clare saw the nature of
the accident which had happened, and,
with kind sympathy for her niece’s great
disappointment, folded her affectionately
in her arms.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi">“IT is vexatious, my Dora, very vexatious,”
said Miss Clare, in a tone of
condolence; “it is trying to you,
after all the pains which you have
bestowed on your work, to see that work
suddenly spoiled. But still take comfort,
dear child, in the thought that no labor
undertaken for our Master can really be
lost.”</p>

<p>Dora sobbed more bitterly than before,
for she knew that hers had not been labor
undertaken for the Master, and she felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
that her time and toil had been worse
than lost.</p>

<p>Miss Clare did all that she could to
comfort her favorite niece. She showed
Dora the beautiful brooch which she herself
valued so greatly; she told her that
she had brought it as a birthday remembrance;
but, much to the lady’s surprise,
Dora only shook her head sadly, and
sobbed forth, “Not for me—not for me!
Oh, that model, I wish that I never had
touched it—I wish that I had never set a
stitch in one of those curtains!”</p>

<p>“I see that you are distressed, very
naturally distressed, by the mishap which
has befallen your curtains, fearing that
thereby the whole model may be spoilt,”
observed Theodora. “You are thinking
of the disappointment of your brother and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
sisters, of the Ragged-school children who
are coming to-day, of my friends who are
invited to see the model. You think that
there is no time to repair the effects of
the spilling the scarlet ink; but I think
that I see a way to remedy the mischief;”
and Miss Clare, as she spoke, placed
before the weeping girl her beautiful embroidered
scarf. “I had intended to give
this to Agnes when I gave you the miniature
brooch, but I will now alter my plan.
I will try to find out, or purchase, some
other remembrance for Agnes; and, with
a little alteration, do you not think, my
sweet girl, that this work will do nicely
for the inner curtains and veil?”</p>

<p>“A thousand times better than mine
could have done!” exclaimed Dora, darting
a glance of almost fierce dislike at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
embroidery, now stained and marred,
which she had once surveyed with such
proud admiration.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said Miss Clare, very
kindly; “for though the Indian scarf may
be—certainly is in itself more beautiful
than your curtains, we cannot see in it
the same token of patient perseverance in
making what was intended to be a humble
offering of love to the Lord.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Theodora, I can stand this
no longer!” exclaimed Dora, almost choking
with the violence of her emotion;
“you must know all, I can hide it no
more; you must hear what a naughty,
naughty girl I have been!”</p>

<p>Then, as well as she could through her
tears and her sobs, Dora relieved herself
of the burden of concealment which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
become at last intolerable. She told
everything to her aunt—the first fault,
the breaking of the fourth commandment;
then the falsehood, the deceit which had
followed, for when did an unrepented sin
ever stand alone! Dora concluded by
passionately exclaiming, “You cannot, you
must not, give me the brooch—Agnes has
deserved it much better; she has been
conquering her temper and doing all that
she can to please mamma, while I have
been only a hypocrite! Please give the
brooch to Agnes, and the scarf for the
model; I could not bear now to take
either—I who have only deserved to be
punished!”</p>

<p>Miss Clare was surprised, pained, disappointed
by what she now heard; yet
there was comfort to her in seeing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
now at least her poor niece was heartily
repenting.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you, my child, how
thankful I am that this accident has
happened to your work, and that you have
been led to speak out bravely at last,”
said her aunt, putting her arm round
Dora, and drawing her tenderly towards
her, so that the poor girl could weep on
her bosom.</p>

<p>“Then you don’t despise me—you won’t
give me up?” murmured Dora, crying still,
but much more softly.</p>

<p>“Give you up—never!” cried the aunt,
and she pressed a kiss upon Dora’s brow.
“It may be a question, indeed, whether I
had not better reserve the brooch till
next birthday.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I never could take it, never!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
cried Dora, excitedly; “let it be given to
Agnes.”</p>

<p>“Do you think, Dora, that by giving
up the brooch you are winning a claim to
forgiveness—that by this sacrifice you are
atoning for what you have done wrong?”
asked Miss Clare. “If so, I am bound to
tell you that you are mistaken.”</p>

<p>“No, aunt,” replied Dora, for the first
time raising her eyes, heavy with weeping,
and looking her godmother full in the
face; “I know that nothing that I can do
can atone for my sin—that there is but
one Atonement; but I feel as if I could
not take the brooch which you meant to
give to a good girl, and which I have so
little”— Dora could not finish the sentence,
tears came again, and she hid her
face on the bosom of her aunt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Clare hesitated no longer. She
felt that it would deeply impress on the
mind of Dora the painful lesson which
she was learning, if she saw the brooch in
the possession of her elder twin. What
Theodora had heard from Mrs. Temple of
the marked improvement in the character
of Agnes, convinced her that she was the
sister who best deserved to receive the
miniature of her mother. Miss Clare
made a sacrifice of her own inclination in
thus deciding to follow her judgment, but
she was in the habit of doing what she
thought right, instead of what she thought
pleasant.</p>

<p>“I will confess all to mamma, now, just
as I have done to you—I won’t be a hypocrite
any longer,” murmured Dora, as
soon as she had recovered power to speak.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“And there is Another to whom my
child must also confess,” said Miss Clare,
still with her arm round her niece, still
with Dora’s head on her breast; “there
is One who is ready freely to forgive every
penitent who approaches the Mercy-seat
pleading the merits of Christ. We have
no power to remove one spot from our
souls;” the eyes of Miss Clare chanced to
rest, as she spoke, on the embroidery,
stained and destroyed; “but there is the
Lord’s promise to comfort the broken and
contrite heart, ‘Though your sins be as
scarlet, they shall be white as snow—though
they be red as crimson, they shall
be as wool.’”</p>

<p>Dora and her aunt knelt down together
and together prayed, but in silence.
When Dora rose from her knees, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
she was still very sad and subdued, there
was a peace in her heart, a sense of sin
forgiven, which she had not experienced
for months.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">“DORA is late—shockingly late—on
her birthday too! I <i>am</i> surprised!”
exclaimed Elsie, who was in a
fidget of impatience to present her
sister with a marker which she had made.</p>

<p>“And Aunt has kept us twenty—more
than twenty minutes waiting for prayers!”
cried Amy; “I am surprised, for she
always is so punctual.”</p>

<p>“And Agnes has employed the time
mending my gloves, the most surprising
thing of all,” laughed Lucius.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why so surprising?” asked Elsie.</p>

<p>“Because a few months ago Agnes was
much more given to picking holes than to
sewing them up,” answered the boy. “I
liked to plague her and she to tease me,
and I thought that we should always live
a kind of cat-and-dog life together. But
now we’re going to be grand allies,”
added the merry boy, clapping Agnes
upon the shoulder; “by your example
you’ll help to mend my manners as well
as my gloves!”</p>

<p>Lucius spoke in his saucy playful way,
but “there’s many a true word spoken in
jest,” and he was but expressing what all
the family had observed, that there was
gradual but steady improvement in the
outer conduct of the once peevish and selfish
girl.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>But the sharpest conflict of Agnes upon
her twelfth birthday had been against a
jealous spirit within. From a few words
dropped by her aunt on the previous
evening, Agnes felt sure that her mother’s
likeness would be given as a birthday
present to one of the twins, and she had
not a doubt that the younger would be
the one thus favored.</p>

<p>“It was just the same last birthday,”
thought Agnes with bitterness: “I am
given some makeshift, Dora has what is
really of value. It is rather hard that she
should always be preferred before her
elder sister because she is called after my
aunt, whilst I am named after my mother.
But oh! how wicked is this feeling of
jealousy, how sinful these unkind and
covetous thoughts! Lord! help me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
overcome this secret temptation, and to
feel pleasure, real pleasure, when I see
Dora wearing that which is so precious to
us both!”</p>

<p>As the thought, or rather the prayer,
passed through the mind of Agnes, the
door opened and Miss Clare entered, followed
by Dora. The lady held the beautiful
brooch in her hand, and going up to
the elder twin whom she had not met
before on that morning, with a kiss and a
whispered blessing, fastened the precious
jewel on her breast.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That twenty-fourth day of December
was a day long remembered with delight
by many a poor child in Chester, for large
was the number of scholars (it would be
scarcely just to call them ragged) who enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the feast and the varied amusements
provided for them in the large red
house by their benefactress, Miss Clare.</p>

<p>Specially was the beautiful, the wonderful
model which the young gentlefolk
had made, the theme of many a conversation
in the low courts and lanes from
which the guests had been gathered.
Worn, weary mothers, at their sewing or
washing, paused, needle in hand, or with
arms whitened with soap-suds, to hear of
the golden pillars, and silver loops, and
above all of the splendid embroidery that
adorned the inner part of the model, that
part which, as Miss Clare had told them,
was called the Holy of holies.</p>

<p>“And the young ladies looked just as
pleased and happy as we,” a bare-footed
little urchin observed at the end of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
lively narration of all the wonders that he
had seen; “all but one, and her eyes
were red as if she’d been a-crying,—what
could <i>she</i> have had to make her cry?
But she smiled, too, when we clapped our
hands and shouted for joy as we saw the
beautiful tent!”</p>

<p>What delighted their eyes, and pleased
their fancy, was what naturally made the
greatest impression on the ragged scholars
who had stared in wondering admiration
on the model of the Tabernacle of Israel.
But the concluding words of a little
address made by Miss Clare to the children
were what sank deepest into the
memories and hearts of her twin nieces.</p>

<p>“I have described to you, my dear
young pupils, the various parts of this
model,” she said: “let me now briefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
point out a few lessons which we should
all carry away. In Israel’s Tabernacle
we see a <small>TYPE</small> of every Christian, in whose
body, as St. Paul tells us, God’s Holy
Spirit deigns to dwell (1 Cor. iii. 16). In
that living Tabernacle, the lowly heart is
the Holy of holies, because it is cleansed
by the blood of sprinkling, in it the Commandments
of God are treasured, and the
light of His love shines within. But as
the Tabernacle was not intended to last
forever, but to give place to a far more
splendid building, so is it with these
bodies of ours. As Solomon’s magnificent
temple, glorious and fair, and firm on
its deep foundation, far surpassed the
Tabernacle made to be moved from place
to place; so will the glorified bodies of
saints, when they are raised from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
graves, surpass these weak, mortal bodies
in which they served their Lord upon
earth. For what saith the Apostle St.
Paul:—‘<span class="smcap">We know that if our earthly
house of this Tabernacle were dissolved,
we have a building of God, a house
not made with hands, eternal in the
heavens.</span>’” (2 Cor. v. 1.)</p>

<h2>THE BEAR.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-289-h.jpg" width="45" height="111" alt="H" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">“HE is just like a bear!” that is a very
common expression when we talk
of some ill-tempered man or boy,
who takes a pleasure in saying
rude things, and who seems bent upon
making every one near him as uncomfortable
as he can.</p>

<p>But we may be unjust even to bears.
Could you have gone to wintry Greenland,
and seen Mrs. Bruin amidst her family of
little white cubs, each scarcely bigger
than a rabbit, you would have agreed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
a bear can be a kind and tender mother,
and provide for her four-footed babies a
snug and comfortable home.</p>

<p>You would, indeed, have had some
difficulty in finding Bear Hall, or Bear
Hole, as we rather should call it. Perhaps
in wandering over the dreary snow-covered
plains of Greenland, you might
have come upon a little hole in the snow,
edged with hoar-frost, without ever guessing
that the hole was formed by the warm
breath of an Arctic bear, or that Mrs.
Bruin and her promising family were
living in a burrow beneath you.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> How
wonderfully does Instinct teach this rough,
strange-looking creature to provide for
her cubs! The mother-bear scrapes and
burrows under the snow, till she has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
formed a small but snug home, where she
dwells with her baby-bears during the
sharpest cold of an Arctic winter. So
wonderfully has Providence cared for the
comfort even of wild beasts, that the
mother needs no food for three months!
She is so fat when she settles down in her
under-snow home, that her own plumpness
serves her instead of breakfast, dinner,
and supper; so that when at last she
comes out to break her long fast, she is
not starved, but has merely grown thin.</p>

<p>I need hardly remind my reader that the
Arctic bear is provided by Nature with a
thick, warm, close-fitting coat of white fur;
and the snow itself, strange as it seems to
say so, serves as a blanket to keep the
piercing air from her narrow den.</p>

<p>Yes, Mrs. Bruin was a happy mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
though her cell was small to hold her and
her children, and the cold above was so
terrible that water froze in the dwellings
of men even in a room with a fire. Mrs
Bruin found enough of amusement in
licking her cubs, which was her fashion of
washing, combing, and dressing, and making
them look like respectable bears. She
let them know that she loved them dearly
in that kind of language which little ones,
whether they be babies or bear-cubs, so
soon understand.</p>

<p>But when March came, Mrs. Bruin began
to grow hungry, and think that it was
full time to scramble out of her under-snow
den, and look out for some fish, or a
fat young seal, to eat for her breakfast.
The weather was still most fearfully cold,
and the red sun seemed to have no power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
at all, save to light up an endless waste of
snow, in which not a tree was to be seen
save here and there a stunted fir, half
crusted over with ice.</p>

<p>Safe, however, and pretty warm in their
shaggy furs, over the dreary wilds walked
Mrs. Bruin, and the young bears trotted
at her heels. They went along for some
time, when they came to a round swelling
in the snow; at least so a little hut appeared
to the eyes of a bear. Indeed,
had our own eyes looked on that snow-covered
hillock, we should scarcely at first
have guessed that it was a human dwelling.</p>

<p>Perhaps some scent of food came up
from the chimney-hole, which made Mrs.
Bruin think about breakfast, for she went
close up to the hut, then trotted around
it—her rough white nose in the air. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
then uttered a low short growl, which
made her cubs scramble up to her side.</p>

<p>Oh, with what terror the sound of that
growl filled the heart of poor Aneekah,
the Esquimaux woman, who was with her
little children crouching together for
warmth in that hut!</p>

<p>“Did you hear that noise?” exclaimed
Aleekan, the eldest boy, stopping suddenly
in the midst of a tale which he had been
telling.</p>

<p>“There’s a bear outside!” cried all the
younger children at once.</p>

<p>Aneekah rose, and hastily strengthened
the fastenings of her rude door with a
thick piece of rope, while her children
breathlessly listened to catch again the
sound which had filled them with fear.</p>

<p>“The bear is climbing up outside!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
cried little Vraga, clinging in terror to her
mother. “I can hear the scraping of its
claws!”</p>

<p>There was an anxious pause for several
minutes, all listening too intently to break
the silence by even a word. Then, to the
great alarm of the Esquimaux, the white
head of an Arctic bear could be plainly
seen, looking down upon them from above.
The animal had, after clambering up to the
top of the hut, enlarged the hole which
had been left in the roof to let out the
smoke.</p>

<p>“We’re lost!” exclaimed Aneekah.</p>

<p>“O mother let us pray! Will not God
help us?” cried one of the children.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>The prayer could have been but a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
short one, but the presence of mind which
the mother showed may have been given
as the instant answer to it. Aneekah
caught up a piece of moss, stuck it on a
stick, set it on fire, and held the blazing
mass as close as she could to the nose of
the bear.</p>

<p>Now fire was a new thing to Mrs. Bruin,
and so was smoke; and if the bear had
frightened the Esquimaux, the Esquimaux
now frightened the bear. With a snort
and a shake of her shaggy fur, the animal
drew back her head, and, to the surprise
and delight of the trembling family,
they soon heard their unwelcome visitor
scrambling down faster than she had
clambered up. Mrs. Bruin trotted off to
seek her breakfast elsewhere; let us hope
that she and her cubs found a fine supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
of fish frozen in a cleft in some iceberg
floating away in the sea. At any rate
they never again were seen near the Esquimaux
home.</p>

<p>Do you wonder how the poor Esquimaux
child had learned the value of prayer?
Would any one go to the dreary wilds of
Greenland to carry the blessed gospel to
the natives of that desolate shore?</p>

<p>Yes, even to “Greenland’s icy mountains”
have missionaries gone from brighter,
happier lands. There are pastors
now laboring amongst the poor Esquimaux,
for they know that the soul of each
savage is precious. The light of the
gospel is shining now in Esquimaux homes,
and, amidst all their hardships, sufferings,
and dangers, Esquimaux have learned to
show pious trust when in peril, and thankfulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
after deliverance. It is from the
pen of a missionary that we have learned
the story which I have just related of the
Esquimaux woman and the white bear.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi">“REALLY, Captain Guise, you need
trouble yourself no more in the
matter; I am quite able to take
care of myself!” cried young Cornet
Stanley, with a little impatience in his
tone.</p>

<p>The speaker was a blue-eyed lad, whose
fresh complexion showed that he had not
been long in the burning climate of India.
Cornet Stanley had indeed but lately left
an English home, for he was little more
than sixteen years of age. With very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
anxious feelings, and many tears, had Mrs.
Stanley parted with her rosy-cheeked Norman.
“He is so very young,” as she
said, “to meet all the trials and temptations
of an officer’s life in India!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Stanley’s great comfort was that
her Norman would have a tried and steady
friend in her cousin, Captain Guise, who
would, she felt sure, act a father’s part to
her light-hearted boy. Young Stanley
was appointed to the same regiment as
that of the captain; and almost as soon
as the cornet had landed in India, he proceeded
up country to join it. The season
of the year was that which is in India
called the cold weather, when many Europeans
live in tents, moving from place to
place, that they may amuse themselves
with hunting and shooting. Norman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Stanley, who had never before chased anything
larger than a rabbit, was delighted
to make one of a party with two of his
brother officers, and enjoy with them for a
while a wild, free life in the jungle. There
would have been no harm at all in this,
had Norman’s new companions been sober
and steady young men; but Dugsley and
Danes were noted as the two wildest officers
in the regiment.</p>

<p>Captain Guise was also out in camp,
and his tent was pitched not very far from
that of his young friend Norman. The
captain took a warm interest in young
Stanley, not only for the sake of his parents,
but also for his own; for the bright rosy
face and frank manner of the lad inclined
all who met him to feel kindly towards
him. It was with no small regret that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Captain Guise, on the very first evening
when the officers all dined together, saw
that young face flushed not with health,
but with wine, and that frank manner become
more boisterous than it had been
earlier in the day. Not that Norman
Stanley could have been called drunk,
but he had taken a little more wine than
was good for him to take; and his friend
knew but too well in what such a beginning
of life in India was likely to end.</p>

<p>The captain was a good and sensible
man, and he could not see his young relative
led into folly and sin without warning
him of the danger into which he was
heedlessly running. Captain Guise, on the
following day, therefore, visited Norman
in his tent, and tried to put him on his
guard against too close a friendship with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Dugsley and Danes, and to show him the
peril of being drawn by little and little
into intemperate habits.</p>

<p>Norman Stanley, who thought himself
quite a man because he could wear a uniform
and give commands to gray-bearded
soldiers, was a little hurt at any one’s
thinking of troubling him with advice.
Captain Guise had, however, spoken so
kindly that the lad could not take real
offence at his words, but only tried to show
his friend that his warning was not at all
needed.</p>

<p>“I shall never disgrace myself by becoming
a drunkard, you may be certain of
that,” said the youth; “no one despises
a sot more than I do, and I shall never be
one. As for taking an extra glass of champagne
after a long day’s shooting, that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
quite a different thing, and nobody can
object to it.”</p>

<p>“But the extra glass, Norman, is often
like the thin point of the wedge,” said the
captain; “it is followed by another and
another, till a ruinous habit may be formed.”</p>

<p>“I tell you that I shall never get into
habits of drinking,” interrupted young
Stanley. Then, as he took up his gun to
go out shooting, the cornet uttered the
words with which this little story commences.</p>

<p>Captain Guise did not feel satisfied.
He saw that his young friend was relying
on the strength of his own resolutions,
and in so doing was leaning on a reed.
He could not, however, say anything more
just then, and Norman Stanley started a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
new subject to give a turn to the conversation.</p>

<p>“By-the-by, Captain Guise, I’ve not
shown you the prize which I captured
yesterday. As Dugsley and I were beating
about in the jungle, what should we
light upon but a tiger-cub—a real little
beauty, pretty and playful as a young
kitten.”</p>

<p>“What did you make of it?” asked the
captain.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve tethered it to the tree yonder,”
said Norman, pointing to one not a
hundred yards distant. “By good luck I
had a dog’s chain and collar which fitted
the little creature exactly. I mean to try
if I can’t rear it, and keep a tiger-cub as a
pet.”</p>

<p>“A tiger-cub is rather a dangerous pet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
I should say,” observed Captain Guise,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, not a bit of it!” cried Norman,
lightly; “the little brute has no fangs to
bite with, and if it had, the chain is quite
strong enough to”—</p>

<p>The sentence was never finished, for
while the last word was yet on the smiling
lips of the youth, the sudden sound of a
savage roar from a neighboring thicket
made him start, turn pale, and grasp his
gun more firmly. Forth from the shade
of the bushes sprang a large tigress. In a
minute, with a few bounds, she had cleared
the space between herself and her cub!
Snap went the chain, as the strong wild
beast caught up her little one in her
mouth; and before either Norman or the
captain (who had snatched up a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
gun) had time to take aim, the tigress was
off again, bearing away her rescued cub
to the jungle!</p>

<p>“That was a sight worth seeing!” exclaimed
Captain Guise; “I never beheld
a more splendid creature in all my life!”</p>

<p>Norman, who was very young, and quite
unaccustomed to having a tiger so near
him with no iron cage between them,
looked as though he had not enjoyed the
sight at all. “I should not care to meet
that splendid creature alone in the jungle,”
he observed. “Did you not notice how
the iron chain snapped like a thread at
the jerk which she gave it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Captain Guise, as he
turned back into the tent; “what will hold
in the cub, is as a spider’s web to the full-grown
wild beast. You had, as I told you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
a dangerous pet, Norman Stanley. You
might play for a while with the young creature,
but claws will lengthen and fangs
will grow. And,” the captain added more
gravely, “this is like some other things
which are at first but a source of amusement,
but which are too likely to become
at last a source of destruction.”</p>

<p>Norman Stanley’s cheek reddened, for
he felt that it was not merely of a tiger’s
cub that his friend was speaking. Evil
habits, which at first seem so weak that
we believe that we can hold them in by a
mere effort of will, grow fearfully strong by
indulgence. Many a wretched drunkard
has begun by what he called merely a
little harmless mirth, but has found at last
that he had been fostering something
more dangerous still then a tiger’s cub.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
His good resolutions have snapped; he
has been carried away by a terrible force
with which he has not had the strength to
grapple; and so has proved the truth of
the captain’s words, that what is at first
but a source of amusement may be at last
a source of destruction.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">“NO, neighbor, you’ve not one too
many,” observed Bridget Macbride,
as she stood in the doorway of the
cottage of Janet Maclean, knitting
coarse gray socks as fast as her fingers
could go.</p>

<p>“It’s easy enough for you to say so,”
replied Janet, who was engaged in ironing
out a shirt, and who seemed to be too
busy even to look up as she spoke—“it’s
easy enough for you to say so, Bridget
Macbride. You’ve never had but three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
bairns [children] in your life, and your
husband he gets good wages. You’d sing
to a different tune, I take it, if you’d nine
bairns, as I ha’e, the oldest not twelve
years old—nine to feed, to clothe, and to
house, and to toil and moil for, and your
goodman getting but seven shillings
a-week, though he’s after the sheep from
morning till night!” Mrs. Maclean had
been getting quite red in the face as she
spoke, but that might have been from
stooping over her ironing work.</p>

<p>“Still children are blessings,—at least,
I always thought mine so,” observed
Bridget Macbride.</p>

<p>“Blessings; yes, to be sure!” cried
Janet; “I thought so too till there were
so many of them that we had to pack in
the cottage like herrings in a barrel.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Janet was now ironing out a sleeve, and
required to go rather more gently on with
her work. “I’m sure nae folk welcomed
little ones more than Tam and I did the
four first wee bairns, though many a
broken night’s rest we had wi’ poor Jeanie,—and
I shall never forget the time when
the measles was in our cottage, and every
ane o’ the four had it! Yes,” the mother
went on, “four we could manage pretty
well, with a wee bit o’ pinching and scraping;
but then came <i>twins;</i> and then little
Davie; and afore he could toddle alane,
twins again!” and Janet banged down her
iron on its stand, as if two sets of twins
were too much for the patience of any
parent to endure.</p>

<p>“You must have a struggle to keep
them all,” observed Bridget Macbride.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>“Struggle! I should say so!” cried
Janet, looking more flushed and angry
than ever. “We never could have got on
at all, had I not taken in washing and
ironing; and it’s no such easy matter, I
can tell you, to wash and iron fine things
for the gentry with twin-babies a-wanting
you to look after them every hour in the
twenty-four!” It seemed as if the babies
had heard themselves mentioned, for from
the rude cradle by the fire came a squall,
first from one child, and then from both,
and poor Janet was several minutes before
she could get either of them quiet again.</p>

<p>“You’ve a busy life of it indeed,” observed
Bridget, as soon as the weary
mother was able once more to take up her
iron.</p>

<p>“’Deed you may say so,” replied Janet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
sharply, plying her iron faster, as if to
make up for lost time. “And for all my
working, and Tam’s, we can scarce get
enough of bread or porridge to fill nine
hungry mouths; and as for meat, we don’t
see it for weeks and weeks—not so much
as a slice of bacon! Then there’s the
schooling of the twa eldest bairns to be
paid for, as Tam and I won’t ha’e them
grow up like heathen savages; and we’ll
hae them gae decent too, not in rags and
barefooted, like beggars. And I should
like to know”—Janet was ironing fast, but
talking faster—“I should like to know how
shoon [shoes] and sarks [shirts], and a
plaidie for this ane, and a bonnet for
anither, and breakfasts o’ bannocks, and
porridge for supper, are a’ to come out of
that wash-tub?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>“And yet,” observed Bridget Macbride,
“hard as you have to work for your children,
I don’t believe that you would willingly
part with one of them, neighbor.”</p>

<p>Even as she spoke, there was a distressful
cry of “Mither! mither!” as Janet’s
two eldest children burst suddenly into the
cottage, looking unhappy and frightened.</p>

<p>“What ails the bairns?” asked Janet
anxiously, turning round at the cry.</p>

<p>“O mither, we’ve lost wee Davie; we
can’t find him nowhere in the wood, and
we be afeard as he may have fallen over
the cliff.”</p>

<p>“Davie! my bairn! my darling!” exclaimed
poor Janet, forgetting in a moment
all her toils and troubles in one terrible
fear. Down went the iron on the table,
and without waiting to put on bonnet or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
shawl, the fond mother rushed out of the
cottage, to go and search for her child.
Bridget had spoken the truth; Janet might
complain of the trouble brought by a large
family, but she could not bear to part with
one out of her flock. If Davie had been
the only child of a rich mother, instead of
the seventh child of a poor one, he could
not have been sought with more eager
anxiety, more tender, self-forgetting love.</p>

<p>Followed by several of her children, but
outstripping them all in her haste, Janet
was soon at the edge of the wood.
“Davie! Davie! my bairn! my bairn!”
resounded through the forest. The
mother’s cry was answered by a distant
whoop and halloo;—Janet knew the voice
of her husband, and her heart took courage
from the sound. But her hope was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
changed into delight, when she caught a
glimpse between the trees of the shepherd
coming towards her, with her little yellow-haired
laddie Davie perched on his broad
shoulders, grasping with one hand his
father’s rough locks, and with the other a
bannock, which he was nibbling at as he
rode.</p>

<p>“The Lord be praised!” cried poor
Janet, and rushing forward she caught the
child from her husband, pressed Davie
closely to her heart, and burst into a flood
of grateful tears.</p>

<p>“You must look a bit better after your
stray lamb, Janet,” said Tam with a good-humored
smile. “I was just crossing the
wood when Trusty set up a barking which
made me go out o’ my way just to see if
he had found a rabbit, or started a blackcock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
There was our wean [child] sitting
much at his ease, munching a bannock, as
contented and happy as if he’d been a
duke eating venison out of a golden dish.
But you mustna let the wee bairn wander
about by himsel’, for if he’d gaen over the
cliff, we’d never hae heard the voice o’ our
lammie again.”</p>

<p>Very joyful and very thankful was Janet
Maclean, as, with her boy in her arms, she
returned to her cottage. Bridget had remained
there to take care of the twins
during the absence of their mother. Mrs.
Macbride received her neighbor with a
smile, and the words, “Didna I say, Janet,
that ye’d not one too many, nor would
willingly part wi’ a single bairn out o’ your
nine?”</p>

<p>“The Lord forgie my thankless heart!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
said poor Janet, and she fondly kissed her
boy. “We ne’er are grateful enough for
our blessings until we are like to lose
them.” Then putting the little child down
on the brick floor, with fresh courage and
industry the mother returned to her ironing
again.</p>

<p>May we not hope that all Janet’s toil
and hard work for her children had one
day a rich reward? May we not hope
that not one out of the nine, when old
enough and strong enough to labor for
her who had labored so hard for them,
but did his best to repay her care and her
love? How large is a parent’s heart, that
opens wide and wider to take in all the
children of her family, however numerous
those children may be! Though each
new babe adds to poor parents’ toils, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
takes from their comforts, still the kind
father and the fond mother, as they look
round their home circle of rosy faces, can
not only say but feel, “There is not one
too many.”</p>

<h2>THE IRON RING.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-176-drop-c.jpg" width="52" height="115" alt="C" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">CHANG WANG was a Chinaman,
and was reputed to be one of the
shrewdest dealers in the Flowery
Land. If making money fast be
the test of cleverness, there was not a merchant
in the province of Kwang Tung who
had earned a better right to be called
clever. Who owned so many fields of the
tea-plant, who shipped so many bales of
its leaves to the little island in the west,
as did Chang Wang? It was whispered,
indeed, that many of the bales contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
green tea made by chopping up spoilt
black tea-leaves, and coloring them with
copper—a process likely to turn them into
a mild kind of poison; but if the unwholesome
trash found purchasers, Chang Wang
never troubled himself with the thought
whether any one might suffer in health
from drinking his tea. So long as the
dealer made money, he was content; and
plenty of money he made.</p>

<p>But knowing how to make money is
quite a different thing from knowing how
to enjoy it. With all his ill-gotten gains,
Chang Wang was a miserable man, for he
had no heart to spend his silver pieces,
even on his own comfort. The rich dealer
lived in a hut which one of his own laborers
might have despised; he dressed as a poor
Tartar shepherd might have dressed when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
driving his flock. Chang Wang grudged
himself even a hat to keep off the rays of
the sun. Men laughed, and said that he
would have cut off his own pigtail of plaited
hair, if he could have sold it for the price
of a dinner! Chang Wang was, in fact, a
miser, and was rather proud than ashamed
of the hateful vice of avarice.</p>

<p>Chang Wang had to make a journey to
Macao, down the great river Yang-se-kiang,
for purposes of trade. The question
with the Chinaman now was in what
way he should travel.</p>

<p>“Shall I hire a palanquin?” thought
Chang Wang, stroking his thin moustaches;
“no, a palanquin would cost too
much money. Shall I take my passage
in a trading vessel?” The rich trader
shook his head, and the pigtail behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
it,—such a passage would have to be paid
for.</p>

<p>“I know what I’ll do,” said the miser
to himself; “I’ll ask my uncle Fing Fang
to take me in his fishing-boat down the
great river. It is true that it will make
my journey a long one, but then I shall
make it for nothing. I’ll go to the fisherman
Fing Fang, and settle the matter at
once.”</p>

<p>The business was soon arranged, for
Fing Fang would not refuse his rich
nephew a seat in his boat. But he, like
every one else, was disgusted at Chang
Wang’s meanness; and as soon as the
dealer had left his hovel, thus spoke Fing
Fang to his sons, Ko and Jung:</p>

<p>“Here’s a fellow who has scraped up
money enough to build a second porcelain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
tower, and he comes here to beg a free
passage in a fishing-boat from an uncle
whom he has never so much as asked to
share a dish of his birds’-nests soup.”<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>“Birds’-nests soup, indeed!” exclaimed
Ko; “why, Chang Wang never indulges
in luxuries such as that. If dogs’ flesh<a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
were not so cheap, he’d grudge himself
the paw of a roasted puppy.”</p>

<p>“And what will Chang Wang make of
all his money at last?” said Fing Fang
more gravely; “he cannot carry it away
with him when he dies.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s gathering it up for some one
who will know how to spend it,” laughed
Jung. “Chang Wang is merely fishing
for others; what he gathers, they will
enjoy.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a bright, pleasant day when
Chang Wang stepped into the boat of his
uncle, to drop slowly down the great
Yang-se-kiang. Many a civil word he
said to Fing Fang and his sons, for civil
words cost nothing. Chang Wang sat in
the boat twisting the ends of his long
moustaches, and thinking how much
money each row of plants in his tea-fields
might bring him. Presently, having finished
his calculations, the miser turned to
watch his relations, who were pursuing
their fishing occupation in the way peculiar
to China. Instead of rods, lines, or
nets, the Fing Fang family was provided
with trained cormorants, which are a kind
of bird with a long neck, large appetite,
and a particular fancy for fish.</p>

<p>It was curious to watch a bird diving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
down in the sunny water, and then
suddenly come up again with a struggling
fish in his bill. The fish was, however,
always taken away from the cormorant,
and thrown by one of the Fing Fangs into
a well at the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>“Cousin Ko,” said the miser, leaning
forward to speak, “how is it that your
clever cormorants never devour the fish
they catch?”</p>

<p>“Cousin Chang Wang,” replied the
young man, “dost thou not see that each
bird has an iron ring round his neck, so
that he cannot swallow? He only fishes
for others.”</p>

<p>“Methinks the cormorant has a hard
life of it,” observed the miser, smiling.</p>

<p>“He must wish his iron ring at the
bottom of the Yang-se-kiang.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>Fing Fang, who had just let loose two
young cormorants from the boat, turned
round, and from his narrow slits of Chinese
eyes looked keenly upon his nephew.</p>

<p>“Didst thou ever hear of a creature,”
said he, “that puts an iron ring around
his own neck?”</p>

<p>“There is no such creature in all the
land that the Great Wall borders,” replied
Chang Wang.</p>

<p>Fing Fang solemnly shook the pigtail
which hung down his back. Like many
of the Chinese, he had read a great deal,
and was a kind of philosopher in his
way.</p>

<p>“Nephew Chang Wang,” he observed,
“<i>I</i> know of a creature (and he is not far
off at this moment) who is always fishing
for gain—constantly catching, but never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
enjoying. Avarice—the love of hoarding—is
the iron ring round his neck; and
so long as it stays there he is much like
one of our trained cormorants—he may
be clever, active, successful, but he is
only fishing for others.”</p>

<p>I leave my readers to guess whether
the sharp dealer understood his uncle’s
meaning, or whether Chang Wang resolved
in future not only to catch, but to
enjoy. Fing Fang’s moral might be good
enough for a Chinese heathen, but it does
not go nearly far enough for an English
Christian. If a miser is like a cormorant
with an iron ring round his neck, the man
or the child who lives for his own pleasure
only, what is he but a greedy cormorant
without the iron ring? Who would wish
to resemble a cormorant at all? The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
bird knows the enjoyment of <i>getting;</i> let
us prize the richer enjoyment of <i>giving</i>.
Let me close with an English proverb,
which I prefer to the Chinaman’s parable,—“Charity
is the truest epicure; for
she eats with many mouths.”</p>

<h2>THE ILL WIND.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-075-drop-i-quote.jpg" width="40" height="111" alt="I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">“IT’S an ill wind that blaws naebody
good, Master Harry—we maun say
that,” observed old Ailsie, Mrs. Delmar’s
Scotch nurse, as she went to
close the window, through which rushed
in the furious blast; “but I hae a dear
laddie at sea, and when I hear the wind
howl like that, I think”—</p>

<p>“Oh, shut the window, nurse! Quick,
quick! or we’ll have the casement blown
in!” cried Nina. “Did you ever hear
such a gust!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>Ailsie shut the window, but not in time
to prevent some pictures, which the little
lady had been sorting, from being scattered
in every direction over the room.</p>

<p>“Our fine larch has been blown down
on the lawn,” cried Harry, who had sauntered
up to the window.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a pity!” exclaimed his sister,
as she went down on her knees to pick up
the pictures. “Our beauty larch, that was
planted only this spring, and that looked
so lovely with its tassels of green! To
think of the dreadful wind rooting up
that! I’m sure that this at least is an ill
wind, that blows nobody good.”</p>

<p>“You should see the mischief it has
done in the wood,” observed Harry;
“snapping off great branches as if they
were twigs. The whole path through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
wood is strewn with the boughs and the
leaves.”</p>

<p>“I can’t bear the fierce wind,” exclaimed
Nina. “When I was out half an
hour ago I thought it would have blown
me away. I really could scarcely keep
my feet.”</p>

<p>“I could not keep my cap,” laughed
Harry. “Off it scudded, whirling round
and round right into the river, where I
could watch it floating for ever so long.
I shall never get it again.”</p>

<p>“Mischievous, horrid wind!” cried Nina,
who had just picked up the last of her
pictures.</p>

<p>“Oh, missie, ye maunna speak against
the wind—for ye ken who sends it,” observed
the old nurse. “It has its work to
do as we hae ours. Depend on’t, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
proverb is true, ‘It’s an ill wind that blaws
naebody good.’”</p>

<p>“There’s no sense in that proverb,”
said Harry, bluntly. “<i>This</i> wind does
nothing but harm. It has snapped off
the head of mamma’s beautiful favorite
flower”—</p>

<p>“And smashed panes in her greenhouse,”
added Nina.</p>

<p>It was indeed a furious wind that was
blowing that evening, and as the night
came on it seemed to increase. It rattled
the shutters, it shrieked in the chimneys,
it tore off some of the slates, and kept
the children awake with its howling.
The storm lulled, however, before the
morning broke; and when the sun had
risen, all was bright, calm, and serene.</p>

<p>“What a lovely morning after such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
stormy night!” cried Nina, as with her
brother Harry she rambled in the green
wood, while old Ailsie followed behind
them. “I never felt the air more sweet
and fresh, and it seemed so heavy yesterday
morning.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, the wind cleared the air,” observed
Ailsie. “It’s an ill wind that blaws
naebody good.”</p>

<p>“But think of your poor son at sea,”
observed Harry.</p>

<p>“I was just thinking o’ him when I
spake, Master Harry. I was thinking
that maybe that verra wind was filling the
sails o’ his ship, and blawing him hame
all the faster, to cheer the eyes o’ his
mither. It is sure to be in the right
quarter for <i>some one</i>, let it blaw from north,
south, east, or west.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, there’s little Ruth Laurie just before
us,” cried Harry, as he turned a bend
in the woodland path. “What a great
bundle of fagots she is bravely carrying!”</p>

<p>“Let’s ask after her sick mother,”
said Nina, running up to the orphan
child, who was well known to the Delmars.
Ruth dwelt with her mother in a very
small cottage near the wood; and the
children were allowed to visit the widow
in her poor but respectful home.</p>

<p>“Blessings on the wee barefooted
lassie!” exclaimed Ailsie; “I’ll be bound
she’s been up with the lark, to gather up
the broken branches which the wind has
stripped from the trees.”</p>

<p>“That’s a heavy bundle for you to carry,
Ruth!” said Harry; “it is almost as big
as yourself.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>“I shouldn’t mind carrying it were it
twice as heavy and big,” cried the peasant
child, looking up with a bright, happy
smile. “Coals be terrible dear, and we’ve
not a stick of wood left in the shed;
and mother, she gets so chilly of an
evening. There’s nothing she likes so well
as a hot cup of tea and a good warm fire;
your dear mamma gives us the tea, and
you see I’ve the wood for boiling the
water. Won’t mother be glad when she
sees my big fagots; and wasn’t I pleased
when I heard the wind blowing last night,
for I knew I should find branches strewn
about in the morning!”</p>

<p>“Ah,” cried Harry, “that reminds me
of the proverb, ‘’Tis an ill wind that blows
nobody good.’”</p>

<p>“Harry,” whispered Nina to her brother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
“don’t you think that you and I
might help Ruth to fill her poor mother’s
little wood-shed?”</p>

<p>“What! pick up sticks, and carry them
in fagots on our backs? How funny that
would look!” exclaimed Harry.</p>

<p>“We should be doing some good,” replied
Nina. “Don’t you remember that
nurse said that the wind has its work to
do, as we have ours? If it’s an ill wind
that does nobody good, it must be an <i>ill
child</i> that does good to no one.”</p>

<p>Merrily and heartily Harry and Nina
set about their labor of kindness. And
cheerfully, as the children tripped along
with their burdens to the poor woman’s
cottage, Nina repeated her old nurse’s
proverb, “’Tis an ill wind that blows nobody
good.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
